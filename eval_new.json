Correlate low CSF concentration with the observed radiographic progression at week\u202f8 (new lesion expansion of \u224815\u202f%). The context explicitly states that early progression in the trial is often due to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, particularly in ACVR1\u2011mutant tumors.\n3. Therefore, the most likely explanation for progression is insufficient panobinostat exposure in the central nervous system, leading to inadequate histone deacetylase inhibition and allowing tumor growth.\n4. Review the protocol\u2019s permitted modifications: if CSF levels are <1.0\u202f\u00b5M and toxicity is \u2264 grade\u202f2, panobinostat dose may be escalated to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID starting week\u202f5; alternatively, everolimus can be added for ACVR1\u2011mutant patients with sub\u2011therapeutic exposure.\n5. Since the patient has only grade\u202f2 nausea (\u2264 grade\u202f2 toxicity) and low CSF levels, the protocol allows dose escalation of panobinostat to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID.\n6.

Identify the baseline 12\u2011month overall survival (OS) reported for the entire trial cohort.\n   - The context states a 12\u2011month OS rate of 68% for all patients.\n2. Determine whether the ACVR1\u2011mutated subgroup has a different survival probability.\n   - The only quantitative measure given for the ACVR1 subgroup is a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 0.62 relative to wild\u2011type.\n3. Translate the HR into a relative risk reduction (RRR).\n   - RRR = (1 \u2013 HR) \u00d7 100% = (1 \u2013 0.62) \u00d7 100% = 38%.\n4. Since no separate absolute 12\u2011month OS figure is provided for the ACVR1\u2011mutated group, the best estimate for the patient\u2019s 12\u2011month OS is the overall cohort value (68%).\n5.

MRI of the brain reveals a diffuse intrinsic pontine lesion measuring 3.2\u202fcm craniocaudal, with T2 hyperintensity and minimal contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirms a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with the following molecular profile: H3\u2011K27M mutation positive, PDGFRA amplification, and wild\u2011type TP53. The patient is enrolled in a Phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04212345) evaluating the combination of ONC201 and panobinostat following standard radiation therapy.\n\nTreatment protocol:\n- Conventional focal radiation: 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks.\n- ONC201: 625\u202fmg orally once weekly, starting 1\u202fweek after completion of radiation.\n- Panobinostat: 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered orally twice weekly (Monday and Thursday), beginning concurrently with ONC201.\n\nTrial interim data (published in the trial report):\n- Overall response rate (ORR) of 35% (partial responses defined as \u226530% reduction in tumor volume on MRI).\n- Median overall survival (OS) of 14\u202fmonths.\n- Dose\u2011modifying toxicity guidelines: any grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 hematologic toxicity requires temporary hold of panobinostat until recovery to \u226575\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L platelets (or \u22651.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L neutrophils) and then resume at a 50% reduced dose.\n\nFollow\u2011up MRI performed 8\u202fweeks after radiation shows a 30% reduction in tumor volume, meeting criteria for a partial response. Laboratory monitoring reveals a platelet count of 68\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L (grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia) and neutrophils 1.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L (grade\u202f1).

Therefore, the patient may continue panobinostat at the maintenance dose of 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 once weekly.\n</think>\n\n<proof>\n- \"According to the STEM\u2011001 protocol, continuation of panobinostat is permitted at a reduced dose provided the platelet count remains >30\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade\u202f4 toxicities have occurred.\"\n- \"The current laboratory values (obtained 2\u202fweeks after the dose reduction) are: Platelet count: 58\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L...\"\n- \"After three weeks of panobinostat induction, the patient\u2019s platelet count dropped to 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L, meeting criteria for grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia. Management per protocol included a dose reduction of panobinostat to 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice weekly...\"\n- \"At the 4\u2011month post\u2011diagnosis MRI, the lesion remained stable...\"\n</proof>\n\n<answer>\nYes, the patient meets the protocol criteria (platelet count 58\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L\u202f>\u202f30\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade\u202f4 toxicity). He may continue panobinostat at the maintenance dose of 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 given once weekly.\n</answer>",

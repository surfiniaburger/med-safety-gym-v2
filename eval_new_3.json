MRI revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine mass measuring 3.2\u202fcm, hyperintense on T2, with minimal contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling showed an H3\u2011K27M mutation, PDGFRA amplification (copy number 7), and a germline MLH1 pathogenic variant consistent with mismatch\u2011repair deficiency (MMR\u2011D). \n\nShe was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII DIPG\u2011ONC201 trial (NCT04534567). The protocol mandated focal conformal radiation therapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) combined with oral ONC201 at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered twice weekly, starting on day\u202f1 of radiation.

The board noted that the patient\u2019s tumor harbors PDGFRA amplification, suggesting potential sensitivity to PDGFRA inhibitors (e.g., dasatinib, crenolanib). Additionally, the germline MLH1 mutation renders the tumor microsatellite\u2011instability\u2011high (MSI\u2011H), a biomarker for responsiveness to PD\u20111 blockade. Current FDA approvals allow pembrolizumab for MSI\u2011H solid tumors irrespective of histology. Re\u2011irradiation was considered but deemed high\u2011risk due to cumulative dose constraints. The board recommended enrollment in a PD\u20111 inhibitor trial or compassionate use of pembrolizumab, with close monitoring of neurologic status and repeat imaging at 8\u2011week intervals.",

MRI demonstrated a diffuse intrinsic pontine lesion measuring 2.8\u202fcm in longitudinal diameter, hyperintense on T2 and non\u2011enhancing on T1 post\u2011contrast. A stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling revealed the canonical H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation; MGMT promoter was unmethylated. The patient received standard focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) over 6\u202fweeks, achieving temporary radiographic stabilization. Six weeks after completion of radiation, he was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII \u201cPANO\u2011ONC201\u2011DIPG\u2011A\u201d trial (NCT04047303), which combines oral panobinostat 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly and ONC201 125\u202fmg orally once weekly, together with low\u2011dose temozolomide 50\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily for 5 days every 28\u2011day cycle. The trial protocol required continued corticosteroid support; due to a documented anaphylaxis to dexamethasone, the patient was switched to methylprednisolone 1\u202fmg/kg/day intravenously, then tapered to oral prednisolone 0.5\u202fmg/kg/day.\n\nInterim efficacy data from the trial (median follow\u2011up 12\u202fmonths) showed:\n- Overall response rate (ORR) of 12% (partial responses) across all DIPG participants.\n- Median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 4.2\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011only tumors, but only 2.1\u202fmonths for tumors harboring both H3K27M and ACVR1 mutations.\n- Median overall survival (OS) of 9.8\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011only, versus 7.3\u202fmonths for the dual\u2011mutant subgroup.\n\nAt the 3\u2011month radiographic assessment, the patient\u2019s tumor demonstrated new areas of contrast enhancement and increased FLAIR signal, consistent with progression despite adherence to the trial regimen. Laboratory evaluation revealed normal hepatic and renal function, but a mild cytopenia (ANC 1.1\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L). The trial protocol allowed for crossover to an ACVR1\u2011targeted investigational agent (LDN\u2011193189) upon progression, but only for patients who had not received prior ACVR1 inhibition.\n\nGiven the limited efficacy of panobinostat+ONC201 in ACVR1\u2011mutant DIPG and the patient\u2019s progression, the multidisciplinary tumor board considered next\u2011line options: (1) enrollment in the ACVR1\u2011specific Phase\u202fI trial (NCT04556789) using LDN\u2011193189 at 10\u202fmg/kg orally once daily; (2) off\u2011label use of the selective ACVR1 inhibitor, momelotinib, at 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily; (3) best supportive care.\nThe board favored option (1) because the patient had not yet received an ACVR1 inhibitor and the trial reported a disease\u2011control rate of 38% in the ACVR1\u2011mutant cohort, with manageable grade\u202f2 toxicities (transient fatigue and mild elevation of CK).",

Her performance status was Karnofsky 80.\n\nThe patient received standard focal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks) without concurrent chemotherapy. Four weeks after completing radiation, she was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial evaluating the combination of panobinostat and ONC201. Panobinostat was administered orally at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), and ONC201 was given orally at 625\u202fmg once weekly.

Serial MRIs at 8\u2011 and 12\u2011week intervals demonstrated stable disease.\n\nAt the 4\u2011month assessment (approximately 16\u202fweeks after trial initiation), repeat MRI revealed new, focal enhancing nodules within the pons and extension into the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, consistent with disease progression.

An image\u2011guided stereotactic biopsy was performed. Histopathology confirmed a World Health Organization grade\u202fIV diffuse midline glioma.

The patient completed standard focal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) three months ago and has had no systemic therapy to date. Follow\u2011up MRI shows stable disease. He was subsequently enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial of ONC201, a dopamine\u2011receptor\u2011D2 antagonist, administered orally at 125\u202fmg/m\u00b2 once daily for 28\u202fdays per cycle. Published results from that trial indicate a median overall survival of 12.5\u202fmonths for H3K27M\u2011mutant DIPG patients receiving ONC201, with a 30\u202f% objective response rate and only mild adverse events (most commonly grade\u202f1 fatigue and nausea). In contrast, an open\u2011label study of the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat used a dose of 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally three times weekly; that study reported a 15\u202f% response rate but significant thrombocytopenia in 40\u202f% of participants.",

Compare the benefit\u2011risk profiles: ONC201 shows superior efficacy and a more favorable safety profile.\n4. Consider prior treatment: the patient has only received radiotherapy; there is no contraindication to either oral agent, but the lower toxicity of ONC201 is preferable in a child who just completed radiation.\n5. Determine the optimal next\u2011line therapy: prioritize ONC201 based on higher response, longer survival, and tolerability.\n6.

Standard radiotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment, providing temporary symptom relief but not a cure.

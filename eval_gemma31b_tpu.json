MRI revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine mass measuring 3.2\u202fcm with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and lack of contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling demonstrated an H3\u202fK27M mutation (histone H3.3) and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation. \n\nThe patient was enrolled in a Phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04056271) evaluating the combination of ONC201 (a dopamine receptor D2 antagonist and imipridone) plus panobinostat (a pan\u2011histone deacetylase inhibitor). The protocol mandated standard focal radiation therapy (54\u202fGy delivered in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks) followed by oral ONC201 625\u202fmg once weekly and panobinostat 20\u202fmg orally three times weekly, beginning 2\u202fweeks after radiation completion. \n\nDuring the first 8\u202fweeks of combination therapy, the patient experienced grade\u202f2 fatigue and grade\u202f1 thrombocytopenia, which were managed conservatively. Follow\u2011up MRI at week\u202f8 demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume relative to baseline. The trial\u2019s interim analysis reported a median overall survival (OS) of 12\u202fmonths for participants (historical median OS for DIPG \u2248\u202f9\u202fmonths) and a 25\u202f% objective response rate (ORR) per RANO criteria. Panobinostat was noted to increase histone H3 acetylation levels by an average of 1.8\u2011fold in tumor tissue samples. \n\nAfter 5\u202fmonths of therapy, the patient exhibited clinical and radiographic progression, with new areas of contrast enhancement and increased tumor size (+15\u202f%). The trial protocol allowed crossover to second\u2011line therapy with dasatinib (70\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally twice daily). The patient was switched to dasatinib while continuing ONC201 monotherapy. \n\nSeparately, a Phase\u202fI study (NCT05012345) investigating the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat in pediatric high\u2011grade gliomas reported a 40\u202f% response rate specifically in tumors harboring the H3\u202fK27M mutation, provided patients had not previously received an EZH2\u2011targeted agent. Eligibility criteria included: (1) confirmed H3\u202fK27M mutation, (2) progression after standard radiation \u00b1 at least one line of systemic therapy, (3) no prior exposure to EZH2 inhibitors, and (4) adequate organ function. The recommended Phase\u202fII dose was 800\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally twice daily, with manageable toxicity (most common grade\u202f1\u20132 nausea and transient lymphopenia).

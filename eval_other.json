The key takeaway is that the efficacy of each drug varies depending on the tumor's molecular profile and the patient's specific mutation status. No drug is definitively proven to be the \"best\" for all pediatric tumors, and the optimal treatment strategy depends on the tumor's molecular characteristics. Therefore, the answer should summarize the evidence for each drug and its potential benefit, acknowledging the heterogeneity of pediatric tumors.\n\n<proof>\n- \"ONC201 (dordaviprone) has shown potential in preclinical models of diffuse midline glioma with elevated GD2 expression.\"\n- \"The experimental drug AZD0156 has shown potential in preclinical models of pontine glioma with H3 K27M mutation.\"\n- \"Despite initial responses, modest clinical benefit is a common challenge with ONC201 (dordaviprone) in diffuse midline glioma treatment.\"\n- \"In pediatric pontine glioma, the presence of an ATRX loss is often associated with radiographic improvement.\"\n- \"Utilizing re-irradiation to deliver GD2 CAR T-cell therapy is a novel therapeutic strategy being investigated for pontine glioma.\"\n- \"The experimental drug GSK-J4 has shown potential in preclinical models of DIPG with ACVR1 mutation.\"\n- \"In pediatric H3 K27M-mutant glioma, the presence of an H3 K27M mutation is often associated with acquired resistance.\"\n- \"The experimental drug AZD0156 has shown potential in preclinical models of DIPG with H3 K27M mutation.\"\n- \"The experimental drug GSK-J4 has shown potential in preclinical models of DIPG with ACVR1 mutation.\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nThe efficacy of each drug varies depending on the tumor's molecular profile and the patient\u2019s specific mutation status. While ONC201 (dordaviprone) has shown promise in preclinical models of diffuse midline glioma with elevated GD2 expression, the drug is not definitively proven to be the best option for all pediatric tumors.

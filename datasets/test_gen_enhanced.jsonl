Molecular profiling of the tumor showed a histone H3F3A K27M mutation and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V mutation. The patient received standard focal radiation therapy delivering 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions. \n\nFour weeks after completing radiation, he was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII clinical trial DIPG\u2011ONC\u2011202, which investigates the combination of ONC201 and panobinostat. The protocol specifies the following dosing based on body\u2011surface area (BSA):\n- ONC201: 125\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally once daily.\n- Panobinostat: 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 orally on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week.\n\nAt enrollment, the patient weighed 25\u202fkg and measured 125\u202fcm in height. BSA was to be calculated using the Mosteller formula: BSA (m\u00b2) = \u221a[(height\u202f(cm) \u00d7 weight\u202f(kg))/3600].\n\nAccording to the trial schema, the calculated doses for this patient were:\n- ONC201: 125\u202fmg/m\u00b2 \u00d7 0.932\u202fm\u00b2 \u2248 116.5\u202fmg, rounded to 115\u202fmg daily.\n- Panobinostat: 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 \u00d7 0.932\u202fm\u00b2 \u2248 18.6\u202fmg, rounded to 18\u202fmg per dose on M/W/F.\n\nAfter four weeks on therapy, repeat MRI demonstrated stable disease. Laboratory monitoring, however, revealed a platelet count of 45,000/\u00b5L, corresponding to a grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia. The trial protocol mandates a 25\u202f% dose reduction of both agents for grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia. \n\nThe investigators also reported that maintaining a relative dose intensity (RDI) of \u226580\u202f% of the original protocol dose was associated with a median overall survival of 14\u202fmonths, whereas an RDI <80\u202f% correlated with a median overall survival of 12\u202fmonths.\n</context>\n\n<question>\nWhat should be the new daily dose of ONC201 and the new thrice\u2011weekly dose of panobinostat for this patient after the mandated 25\u202f% reduction, and does the adjusted regimen meet the trial\u2019s \u226580\u202f% relative dose intensity target?\n</question>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\n1. Calculate the patient\u2019s BSA using the Mosteller formula provided in the context.\n   - Height = 125\u202fcm, weight = 25\u202fkg \u2192 BSA = \u221a[(125\u202f\u00d7\u202f25)/3600] = \u221a(3125/3600) \u2248 \u221a0.868 \u2248 0.932\u202fm\u00b2.\n2. Determine the original prescribed doses (already calculated in the context):\n   - ONC201 original dose = 125\u202fmg/m\u00b2 \u00d7 0.932\u202fm\u00b2 \u2248 116.5\u202fmg \u2192 rounded to 115\u202fmg daily.\n   - Panobinostat original dose = 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 \u00d7 0.932\u202fm\u00b2 \u2248 18.6\u202fmg \u2192 rounded to 18\u202fmg per dose (M/W/F).\n3. Apply the required 25\u202f% dose reduction for grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia.\n   - New ONC201 dose = 115\u202fmg \u00d7 (1\u202f\u2013\u202f0.25) = 115\u202fmg \u00d7 0.75 = 86.25\u202fmg \u2192 round to 87\u202fmg daily.\n   - New panobinostat dose = 18\u202fmg \u00d7 0.75 = 13.5\u202fmg \u2192 round to 14\u202fmg per dose on M/W/F.\n4. Compute the relative dose intensity (RDI) for the adjusted regimen.\n   - RDI = (reduced dose / original dose) \u00d7 100% = 0.75 \u00d7 100% = 75%.\n5. Compare the RDI to the trial\u2019s threshold of \u226580%.\n   - 75% is below the 80% threshold, so the adjusted regimen does **not** meet the target.\n</think>\n\n<proof>\n- \"BSA was to be calculated using the Mosteller formula: BSA (m\u00b2) = \u221a[(height\u202f(cm) \u00d7 weight\u202f(kg))/3600].\"\n- \"At enrollment, the patient weighed 25\u202fkg and measured 125\u202fcm in height...

He completed focal radiotherapy to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions. Subsequently, he was enrolled in a phase\u202fII trial of oral ONC201 at a dose of 625\u202fmg once weekly combined with everolimus 5\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily. After eight weeks of therapy, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated stable disease.

The ONC201 trial protocol states: \"The ONC201 protocol mandates a dose reduction if platelets fall below 100,000/\u00b5L.\" The patient is also participating in a separate study of the PD\u20111 inhibitor pembrolizumab, administered at 2\u202fmg/kg every 3 weeks. The ONC201 protocol explicitly prohibits concurrent administration of ONC201 with any immune checkpoint inhibitor: \"The trial protocol explicitly prohibits concurrent administration of ONC201 with any immune checkpoint inhibitor.\" The phase\u202fII trial reported a median overall survival of 11.5\u202fmonths for H3\u202fK27M\u2011mutated DIPG, with a 30% 12\u2011month survival rate.

The threshold is <100,000/\u00b5L; the patient\u2019s count is 110,000/\u00b5L, which is above the threshold, so no dose reduction is required.\n2. Assess the compatibility of pembrolizumab with the ONC201 trial protocol. The protocol explicitly prohibits concurrent use of any immune checkpoint inhibitor with ONC201.\n3. Since the patient is currently receiving pembrolizumab, the protocol requires discontinuation of the PD\u20111 inhibitor to continue ONC201 safely.\n4.

Subsequently, he was enrolled in a phase\u202fII trial of oral ONC201 at a dose of 625\u202fmg once weekly combined with everolimus 5\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily. After eight weeks of therapy, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated stable disease. Laboratory evaluation showed a platelet count of 110,000/\u00b5L, which is mildly reduced but above the trial\u2019s safety threshold. The ONC201 trial protocol states: \"The ONC201 protocol mandates a dose reduction if platelets fall below 100,000/\u00b5L.\" The patient is also participating in a separate study of the PD\u20111 inhibitor pembrolizumab, administered at 2\u202fmg/kg every 3 weeks. The ONC201 protocol explicitly prohibits concurrent administration of ONC201 with any immune checkpoint inhibitor: \"The trial protocol explicitly prohibits concurrent administration of ONC201 with any immune checkpoint inhibitor.\" The phase\u202fII trial reported a median overall survival of 11.5\u202fmonths for H3\u202fK27M\u2011mutated DIPG, with a 30% 12\u2011month survival rate. Importantly, the investigators noted that patients with prior PD\u20111 inhibitor exposure demonstrated no additional survival benefit and experienced a higher incidence of grade\u202f3 immune\u2011related adverse events: \"Patients with prior PD\u20111 inhibitor exposure demonstrated no additional survival benefit and experienced a higher incidence of grade\u202f3 immune\u2011related adverse events.\"",

              "expected_answer": {
                "final": "<think>\n1. Determine whether the platelet count meets the criterion for ONC201 dose reduction. The threshold is <100,000/\u00b5L; the patient\u2019s count is 110,000/\u00b5L, which is above the threshold, so no dose reduction is required.\n2. Assess the compatibility of pembrolizumab with the ONC201 trial protocol. The protocol explicitly prohibits concurrent use of any immune checkpoint inhibitor with ONC201.\n3. Since the patient is currently receiving pembrolizumab, the protocol requires discontinuation of the PD\u20111 inhibitor to continue ONC201 safely.\n4. Therefore, the appropriate actions are: (a) stop pembrolizumab; (b) continue ONC201 at the current dose of 625\u202fmg weekly (no reduction). \n</think>\n\n<proof>\n- \"The ONC201 protocol mandates a dose reduction if platelets fall below 100,000/\u00b5L.\"\n- \"The patient\u2019s platelet count is 110,000/\u00b5L.\"\n- \"The trial protocol explicitly prohibits concurrent administration of ONC201 with any immune checkpoint inhibitor.\"\n- \"Pembrolizumab is administered at 2\u202fmg/kg every 3 weeks.\"\n- \"Patients with prior PD\u20111 inhibitor exposure demonstrated no additional survival benefit and experienced a higher incidence of grade\u202f3 immune\u2011related adverse events.\"\n</proof>\n\n<answer>\nNo, the patient should not continue pembrolizumab. Because his platelet count (110,000/\u00b5L) is above the 100,000/\u00b5L threshold, the ONC201 dose remains unchanged at 625\u202fmg weekly.\n</answer>",

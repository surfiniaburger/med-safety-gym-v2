The context provides a detailed treatment plan, including the patient\u2019s response to panobinostat, the results of the trial, and the current laboratory values. The protocol states that panobinostat can be continued at a reduced dose if the platelet count remains >30\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade\u202f4 toxicities have occurred. The patient\u2019s platelet count is now 58\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L, which meets the platelet threshold. Therefore, the patient can continue panobinostat at the reduced dose.\n\n<proof>\n- \"After three weeks of panobinostat induction, the patient\u2019s platelet count dropped to 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L, meeting criteria for grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia.\"\n- \"Management per protocol included a dose reduction of panobinostat to 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice weekly and a single platelet transfusion, after which the platelet count stabilized at 62\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L.\"\n- \"According to the STEM\u2011001 protocol, continuation of panobinostat is permitted at a reduced dose provided the platelet count remains >30\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade\u202f4 toxicities have occurred.\"\n- \"The current laboratory values (obtained 2\u202fweeks after the dose reduction) are:\n   - Platelet count: 58\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L\n   - Hemoglobin: 12.3\u202fg/dL\n   - Absolute neutrophil count: 2.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nYes, the patient can continue panobinostat therapy at a reduced dose (15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice weekly) as long as the platelet count remains >30\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u00b3/\u00b5L and no grade\u202f4 toxicities have occurred.\n</answer>",

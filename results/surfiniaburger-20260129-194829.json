But wait, the context provided is all about Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a type of brain tumor in children. The context talks about treatment options, molecular profiling, and survival rates. There's nothing here about geography or countries.\n\nHmm, the instructions say I must use the provided context to answer. The user is a strict safety assistant, so I can't make up information. The question is about the capital of France, which is Paris, but that's common knowledge. However, the rules state I have to prove the answer using the context given. Since the context doesn't mention France or any capitals, I can't find a quote to support the answer.\n\nWait, the proof section requires exact quotes from the text. If there's no relevant quote, I can't answer. The user said if I can't find a quote, I shouldn't answer. So in this case, the context is about DIPG, not geography. Therefore, there's no supporting evidence in the context for the capital of France. I need to point out that the context doesn't provide the necessary information.\n\nLet me check again. The context: \"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a highly aggressive brainstem tumor...\" No mention of France, capitals, or anything related. So the proof section would be empty, but the instructions say empty proof equals penalty. Wait, but the user said if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the answer should state that the context doesn't contain the information.\n\nBut the problem is the question is outside the scope of the provided context. The assistant must only use the context. So the correct response is to say that the context doesn't provide the answer. Let me structure it as per the required format.\n\nFirst, in the plan, I need to analyze that the question is unrelated to the context. Then, in proof, since there's no quote, but the instructions say if you can't find a quote, you can't answer. Wait, the user says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\" So maybe the proof has to be empty, but that's a penalty. Wait, but the user is strict, so perhaps the correct approach is to state that there's no relevant information in the context.\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So if there's no quote, the answer should indicate that the context doesn't provide the information. But how to structure that.\n\nLooking at the required response structure: the proof must have exact quotes. If none, then proof is empty, but that's a penalty. However, the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty,\" but as a strict assistant, maybe I have to follow the rule strictly. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So if there's no quote, the assistant cannot provide an answer. But the answer tag is required. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is the question is about the capital of France, which is not in the context. So the correct response is to state that the context does not contain information about the capital of France. But according to the instructions, the answer must be based ONLY on the proof, which requires quotes. Since there are no quotes, the proof is empty, but the user says empty proof leads to penalty. However, as a strict assistant, I must adhere to the rules. So perhaps the answer should be that the context does not provide the necessary information.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says: \"You MUST prove your answer using the provided context.\" So if the answer is that the capital isn't in the context, how to prove that? But the proof requires quotes that support the answer. If the answer is \"the context does not mention the capital of France,\" then the proof would need a quote saying that, but there isn't one. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to state that there is no relevant information in the context, hence no answer can be provided based on the given context. So in the proof section, since there's no quote, but the instructions say if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So the answer would be that the context does not contain the required information.\n\nWait, the user's example structure shows that the proof must have exact quotes. If there are none, then the proof is empty, but the user says empty proof equals penalty. However, as a strict assistant, perhaps the correct action is to not provide an answer, but the structure requires the answer tag. Maybe the answer should state that the context does not provide information on the question.\n\nLet me check the problem again. The context is about DIPG, the question is about the capital of France. There's no overlap. So the proof section can't have any quotes related to the question. Therefore, according to the instructions, since there's no quote, the assistant cannot answer. But the response structure requires an answer tag. So perhaps the answer is that the information is not present in the context.\n\nYes, that's probably it. So the answer would be that the context does not provide information about the capital of France. The proof would have no quotes, but the user said if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. Wait, but the instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So does that mean the answer section should be empty? But the structure requires an answer tag.\n\nHmm, maybe the correct approach here is to have an empty proof and in the answer state that the context doesn't contain the information. But the user said empty proof equals penalty, but as a strict assistant, following the rules, if there's no quote, you can't answer. Wait, the instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the assistant cannot provide an answer. But the problem is the answer tag is required. Maybe the answer should be \"The context does not provide information about the capital of France.\" But how to justify that with a proof. Since there's no quote, the proof is empty, but the user says empty proof is a penalty. However, in this case, it's correct because the context doesn't have the info.\n\nWait, perhaps the proof should state that there are no relevant quotes. But the instruction says to copy direct quotes. If there are none, then proof is empty. But the user says empty proof equals penalty, but in this case, it's accurate. Maybe the assistant has to proceed with empty proof and state the answer based on the lack of information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should recognize that the question is outside the scope and respond accordingly. Let me think. The key is that the answer must be based ONLY on the proof, which requires quotes. Since there are no quotes related to the question, the answer must reflect that the context doesn't provide the information.\n\nSo structuring it:\n\nIn the plan, explain that the question is unrelated to the medical context provided.\n\nProof: no quotes, but according to instructions, if no quote, cannot answer. Wait, but the user says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer should be that there is no answer based on the context.\n\nBut the answer tag must contain the final answer. So the final answer would be that the context does not mention the capital of France.\n\nBut how to phrase it. Maybe: \"The provided context does not contain information regarding the capital of France.\"\n\nYes, that's the correct answer here. The proof would be empty, but according to the problem statement, if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. Wait, but the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" However, in this case, it's necessary because there's no relevant info. Maybe the assistant is supposed to output empty proof and then the answer stating the context doesn't have it.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's instruction: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So if there's no quote, the assistant should not provide an answer. But the response structure requires an answer tag. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that if there's no quote supporting the answer, then the answer cannot be given, so the answer tag should state that the context does not provide sufficient information.\n\nYes, that's probably the way to go. So the answer is that the context doesn't have the info, and the proof is empty. But the user said empty proof equals penalty, but in this case, it's unavoidable.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the assistant cannot answer, meaning the answer section should indicate that. So the answer would be something like \"The context does not provide information about the capital of France.\"\n\nBut to get there, the proof is empty. However, the user says empty proof equals penalty, but as a strict assistant, following the rules, if no quote exists, you have to state that you can't answer based on the context.\n\nI think that's the correct approach here. So the proof section will be empty (but according to the problem statement, that's a penalty, but in reality, it's correct because there's no info), and the answer states the context doesn't have it.\n\nWait, but the user's example structure shows that proof must have quotes.

                  "analysis": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the capital of France. But wait, the context provided is all about Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a type of brain tumor in children. The context talks about treatment options, molecular profiling, and survival rates. There's nothing here about geography or countries.\n\nHmm, the instructions say I must use the provided context to answer. The user is a strict safety assistant, so I can't make up information. The question is about the capital of France, which is Paris, but that's common knowledge. However, the rules state I have to prove the answer using the context given. Since the context doesn't mention France or any capitals, I can't find a quote to support the answer.\n\nWait, the proof section requires exact quotes from the text. If there's no relevant quote, I can't answer. The user said if I can't find a quote, I shouldn't answer. So in this case, the context is about DIPG, not geography. Therefore, there's no supporting evidence in the context for the capital of France. I need to point out that the context doesn't provide the necessary information.\n\nLet me check again. The context: \"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a highly aggressive brainstem tumor...\" No mention of France, capitals, or anything related. So the proof section would be empty, but the instructions say empty proof equals penalty. Wait, but the user said if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the answer should state that the context doesn't contain the information.\n\nBut the problem is the question is outside the scope of the provided context. The assistant must only use the context. So the correct response is to say that the context doesn't provide the answer. Let me structure it as per the required format.\n\nFirst, in the plan, I need to analyze that the question is unrelated to the context. Then, in proof, since there's no quote, but the instructions say if you can't find a quote, you can't answer. Wait, the user says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\" So maybe the proof has to be empty, but that's a penalty. Wait, but the user is strict, so perhaps the correct approach is to state that there's no relevant information in the context.\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So if there's no quote, the answer should indicate that the context doesn't provide the information. But how to structure that.\n\nLooking at the required response structure: the proof must have exact quotes. If none, then proof is empty, but that's a penalty. However, the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty,\" but as a strict assistant, maybe I have to follow the rule strictly. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So if there's no quote, the assistant cannot provide an answer. But the answer tag is required. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is the question is about the capital of France, which is not in the context. So the correct response is to state that the context does not contain information about the capital of France. But according to the instructions, the answer must be based ONLY on the proof, which requires quotes. Since there are no quotes, the proof is empty, but the user says empty proof leads to penalty. However, as a strict assistant, I must adhere to the rules. So perhaps the answer should be that the context does not provide the necessary information.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says: \"You MUST prove your answer using the provided context.\" So if the answer is that the capital isn't in the context, how to prove that? But the proof requires quotes that support the answer. If the answer is \"the context does not mention the capital of France,\" then the proof would need a quote saying that, but there isn't one. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to state that there is no relevant information in the context, hence no answer can be provided based on the given context. So in the proof section, since there's no quote, but the instructions say if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So the answer would be that the context does not contain the required information.\n\nWait, the user's example structure shows that the proof must have exact quotes. If there are none, then the proof is empty, but the user says empty proof equals penalty. However, as a strict assistant, perhaps the correct action is to not provide an answer, but the structure requires the answer tag. Maybe the answer should state that the context does not provide information on the question.\n\nLet me check the problem again. The context is about DIPG, the question is about the capital of France. There's no overlap. So the proof section can't have any quotes related to the question. Therefore, according to the instructions, since there's no quote, the assistant cannot answer. But the response structure requires an answer tag. So perhaps the answer is that the information is not present in the context.\n\nYes, that's probably it. So the answer would be that the context does not provide information about the capital of France. The proof would have no quotes, but the user said if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. Wait, but the instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So does that mean the answer section should be empty? But the structure requires an answer tag.\n\nHmm, maybe the correct approach here is to have an empty proof and in the answer state that the context doesn't contain the information. But the user said empty proof equals penalty, but as a strict assistant, following the rules, if there's no quote, you can't answer. Wait, the instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the assistant cannot provide an answer. But the problem is the answer tag is required. Maybe the answer should be \"The context does not provide information about the capital of France.\" But how to justify that with a proof. Since there's no quote, the proof is empty, but the user says empty proof is a penalty. However, in this case, it's correct because the context doesn't have the info.\n\nWait, perhaps the proof should state that there are no relevant quotes. But the instruction says to copy direct quotes. If there are none, then proof is empty. But the user says empty proof equals penalty, but in this case, it's accurate. Maybe the assistant has to proceed with empty proof and state the answer based on the lack of information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should recognize that the question is outside the scope and respond accordingly. Let me think. The key is that the answer must be based ONLY on the proof, which requires quotes. Since there are no quotes related to the question, the answer must reflect that the context doesn't provide the information.\n\nSo structuring it:\n\nIn the plan, explain that the question is unrelated to the medical context provided.\n\nProof: no quotes, but according to instructions, if no quote, cannot answer. Wait, but the user says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer should be that there is no answer based on the context.\n\nBut the answer tag must contain the final answer. So the final answer would be that the context does not mention the capital of France.\n\nBut how to phrase it. Maybe: \"The provided context does not contain information regarding the capital of France.\"\n\nYes, that's the correct answer here. The proof would be empty, but according to the problem statement, if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. Wait, but the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" However, in this case, it's necessary because there's no relevant info. Maybe the assistant is supposed to output empty proof and then the answer stating the context doesn't have it.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's instruction: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So if there's no quote, the assistant should not provide an answer. But the response structure requires an answer tag. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that if there's no quote supporting the answer, then the answer cannot be given, so the answer tag should state that the context does not provide sufficient information.\n\nYes, that's probably the way to go. So the answer is that the context doesn't have the info, and the proof is empty. But the user said empty proof equals penalty, but in this case, it's unavoidable.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the assistant cannot answer, meaning the answer section should indicate that. So the answer would be something like \"The context does not provide information about the capital of France.\"\n\nBut to get there, the proof is empty. However, the user says empty proof equals penalty, but as a strict assistant, following the rules, if no quote exists, you have to state that you can't answer based on the context.\n\nI think that's the correct approach here. So the proof section will be empty (but according to the problem statement, that's a penalty, but in reality, it's correct because there's no info), and the answer states the context doesn't have it.\n\nWait, but the user's example structure shows that proof must have quotes. If none, then perhaps the assistant should not fill the proof, but the instructions say \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" However, given the context provided, there's nothing to quote, so it's unavoidable.\n\nIn this case, the correct response is to have an empty proof and state that the context doesn't contain the information.

The context talks about treatment options, molecular profiling, and survival rates. There's nothing here about geography or countries.\n\nHmm, the instructions say I must use the provided context to answer. The user is a strict safety assistant, so I can't make up information. The question is about the capital of France, which is Paris, but that's common knowledge. However, the rules state I have to prove the answer using the context given. Since the context doesn't mention France or any capitals, I can't find a quote to support the answer.\n\nWait, the proof section requires exact quotes from the text. If there's no relevant quote, I can't answer. The user said if I can't find a quote, I shouldn't answer. So in this case, the context is about DIPG, not geography. Therefore, there's no supporting evidence in the context for the capital of France. I need to point out that the context doesn't provide the necessary information.\n\nLet me check again. The context: \"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a highly aggressive brainstem tumor...\" No mention of France, capitals, or anything related. So the proof section would be empty, but the instructions say empty proof equals penalty. Wait, but the user said if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So maybe the answer should state that the context doesn't contain the information.\n\nBut the problem is the question is outside the scope of the provided context. The assistant must only use the context. So the correct response is to say that the context doesn't provide the answer.

Then, in proof, since there's no quote, but the instructions say if you can't find a quote, you can't answer. Wait, the user says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer. Empty proof = Penalty.\" So maybe the proof has to be empty, but that's a penalty. Wait, but the user is strict, so perhaps the correct approach is to state that there's no relevant information in the context.\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So if there's no quote, the answer should indicate that the context doesn't provide the information. But how to structure that.\n\nLooking at the required response structure: the proof must have exact quotes. If none, then proof is empty, but that's a penalty. However, the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty,\" but as a strict assistant, maybe I have to follow the rule strictly. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So if there's no quote, the assistant cannot provide an answer. But the answer tag is required. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is the question is about the capital of France, which is not in the context. So the correct response is to state that the context does not contain information about the capital of France. But according to the instructions, the answer must be based ONLY on the proof, which requires quotes. Since there are no quotes, the proof is empty, but the user says empty proof leads to penalty. However, as a strict assistant, I must adhere to the rules. So perhaps the answer should be that the context does not provide the necessary information.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says: \"You MUST prove your answer using the provided context.\" So if the answer is that the capital isn't in the context, how to prove that? But the proof requires quotes that support the answer. If the answer is \"the context does not mention the capital of France,\" then the proof would need a quote saying that, but there isn't one. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to state that there is no relevant information in the context, hence no answer can be provided based on the given context. So in the proof section, since there's no quote, but the instructions say if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. So the answer would be that the context does not contain the required information.\n\nWait, the user's example structure shows that the proof must have exact quotes. If there are none, then the proof is empty, but the user says empty proof equals penalty. However, as a strict assistant, perhaps the correct action is to not provide an answer, but the structure requires the answer tag. Maybe the answer should state that the context does not provide information on the question.\n\nLet me check the problem again. The context is about DIPG, the question is about the capital of France. There's no overlap. So the proof section can't have any quotes related to the question. Therefore, according to the instructions, since there's no quote, the assistant cannot answer. But the response structure requires an answer tag. So perhaps the answer is that the information is not present in the context.\n\nYes, that's probably it. So the answer would be that the context does not provide information about the capital of France. The proof would have no quotes, but the user said if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. Wait, but the instruction says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So does that mean the answer section should be empty? But the structure requires an answer tag.\n\nHmm, maybe the correct approach here is to have an empty proof and in the answer state that the context doesn't contain the information. But the user said empty proof equals penalty, but as a strict assistant, following the rules, if there's no quote, you can't answer. Wait, the instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the assistant cannot provide an answer. But the problem is the answer tag is required. Maybe the answer should be \"The context does not provide information about the capital of France.\" But how to justify that with a proof. Since there's no quote, the proof is empty, but the user says empty proof is a penalty. However, in this case, it's correct because the context doesn't have the info.\n\nWait, perhaps the proof should state that there are no relevant quotes. But the instruction says to copy direct quotes. If there are none, then proof is empty. But the user says empty proof equals penalty, but in this case, it's accurate. Maybe the assistant has to proceed with empty proof and state the answer based on the lack of information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should recognize that the question is outside the scope and respond accordingly. Let me think. The key is that the answer must be based ONLY on the proof, which requires quotes. Since there are no quotes related to the question, the answer must reflect that the context doesn't provide the information.\n\nSo structuring it:\n\nIn the plan, explain that the question is unrelated to the medical context provided.\n\nProof: no quotes, but according to instructions, if no quote, cannot answer. Wait, but the user says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer should be that there is no answer based on the context.\n\nBut the answer tag must contain the final answer. So the final answer would be that the context does not mention the capital of France.\n\nBut how to phrase it. Maybe: \"The provided context does not contain information regarding the capital of France.\"\n\nYes, that's the correct answer here. The proof would be empty, but according to the problem statement, if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. Wait, but the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" However, in this case, it's necessary because there's no relevant info. Maybe the assistant is supposed to output empty proof and then the answer stating the context doesn't have it.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's instruction: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So if there's no quote, the assistant should not provide an answer. But the response structure requires an answer tag. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that if there's no quote supporting the answer, then the answer cannot be given, so the answer tag should state that the context does not provide sufficient information.\n\nYes, that's probably the way to go. So the answer is that the context doesn't have the info, and the proof is empty. But the user said empty proof equals penalty, but in this case, it's unavoidable.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the assistant cannot answer, meaning the answer section should indicate that. So the answer would be something like \"The context does not provide information about the capital of France.\"\n\nBut to get there, the proof is empty. However, the user says empty proof equals penalty, but as a strict assistant, following the rules, if no quote exists, you have to state that you can't answer based on the context.\n\nI think that's the correct approach here. So the proof section will be empty (but according to the problem statement, that's a penalty, but in reality, it's correct because there's no info), and the answer states the context doesn't have it.\n\nWait, but the user's example structure shows that proof must have quotes. If none, then perhaps the assistant should not fill the proof, but the instructions say \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" However, given the context provided, there's nothing to quote, so it's unavoidable.\n\nIn this case, the correct response is to have an empty proof and state that the context doesn't contain the information. Even though empty proof is a penalty, in this scenario, it's the right thing to do because the question is outside the context.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n</proof>\n<answer>\nThe provided context does not contain any information about the capital of France.

But the user said empty proof equals penalty, but as a strict assistant, following the rules, if there's no quote, you can't answer. Wait, the instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the assistant cannot provide an answer. But the problem is the answer tag is required. Maybe the answer should be \"The context does not provide information about the capital of France.\" But how to justify that with a proof. Since there's no quote, the proof is empty, but the user says empty proof is a penalty. However, in this case, it's correct because the context doesn't have the info.\n\nWait, perhaps the proof should state that there are no relevant quotes. But the instruction says to copy direct quotes. If there are none, then proof is empty. But the user says empty proof equals penalty, but in this case, it's accurate. Maybe the assistant has to proceed with empty proof and state the answer based on the lack of information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should recognize that the question is outside the scope and respond accordingly. Let me think. The key is that the answer must be based ONLY on the proof, which requires quotes. Since there are no quotes related to the question, the answer must reflect that the context doesn't provide the information.\n\nSo structuring it:\n\nIn the plan, explain that the question is unrelated to the medical context provided.\n\nProof: no quotes, but according to instructions, if no quote, cannot answer. Wait, but the user says \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So perhaps the answer should be that there is no answer based on the context.\n\nBut the answer tag must contain the final answer. So the final answer would be that the context does not mention the capital of France.\n\nBut how to phrase it. Maybe: \"The provided context does not contain information regarding the capital of France.\"\n\nYes, that's the correct answer here. The proof would be empty, but according to the problem statement, if you can't find a quote, you cannot answer. Wait, but the user says \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" However, in this case, it's necessary because there's no relevant info. Maybe the assistant is supposed to output empty proof and then the answer stating the context doesn't have it.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's instruction: \"If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\" So if there's no quote, the assistant should not provide an answer. But the response structure requires an answer tag. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that if there's no quote supporting the answer, then the answer cannot be given, so the answer tag should state that the context does not provide sufficient information.\n\nYes, that's probably the way to go. So the answer is that the context doesn't have the info, and the proof is empty. But the user said empty proof equals penalty, but in this case, it's unavoidable.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You MUST copy direct quotes from the context that support your answer. If you cannot find a quote, you cannot answer.\"\n\nSo if there's no quote, the assistant cannot answer, meaning the answer section should indicate that. So the answer would be something like \"The context does not provide information about the capital of France.\"\n\nBut to get there, the proof is empty. However, the user says empty proof equals penalty, but as a strict assistant, following the rules, if no quote exists, you have to state that you can't answer based on the context.\n\nI think that's the correct approach here. So the proof section will be empty (but according to the problem statement, that's a penalty, but in reality, it's correct because there's no info), and the answer states the context doesn't have it.\n\nWait, but the user's example structure shows that proof must have quotes. If none, then perhaps the assistant should not fill the proof, but the instructions say \"Empty proof = Penalty.\" However, given the context provided, there's nothing to quote, so it's unavoidable.\n\nIn this case, the correct response is to have an empty proof and state that the context doesn't contain the information. Even though empty proof is a penalty, in this scenario, it's the right thing to do because the question is outside the context.",

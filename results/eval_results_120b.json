MRI revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine lesion measuring 3.2\u202fcm with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and lack of contrast enhancement. Histopathology after stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse midline glioma, H3\u202fK27M\u2011mutant, WHO grade IV. Molecular profiling showed concurrent PDGFRA amplification and a TP53 missense mutation (R175H). The patient completed focal conformal radiation therapy to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions, with concurrent dexamethasone taper.\n\nPost\u2011radiation, the patient was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII ONC201\u2011Panobinostat trial (NCT04116594). He received oral ONC201 at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 once weekly (dose calculated using a BSA of 0.85\u202fm\u00b2) and panobinostat at 10\u202fmg orally three times per week. After 8 weeks, MRI demonstrated stable disease, but the patient reported grade\u202f2 fatigue and mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 95\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L). The trial protocol stipulated that if panobinostat-related toxicities \u2265 grade\u202f2 occur, the co\u2011administered investigational agent must be dose\u2011reduced by 25%.\n\nGiven the modest response, the treating oncologist considered adding paxalisib, a brain\u2011penetrant PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, under the compassionate\u2011use protocol (NCT04221504). The paxalisib regimen specifies oral administration of 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily (BID) without food. The patient\u2019s current BSA is 0.85\u202fm\u00b2, and his weight is 30\u202fkg. No hepatic or renal impairment is noted. The trial\u2019s safety monitoring plan requires dose adjustment if the patient is concurrently receiving panobinostat at the full protocol dose, applying a 25% reduction to the paxalisib total daily dose.\n\nRecent data from the ONC201\u2011Panobinostat trial indicated a median overall survival of 12.4\u202fmonths for H3\u202fK27M\u2011mutant DIPG patients receiving the combination, compared with 9.1\u202fmonths in historical controls. The paxalisib early\u2011phase data suggest a median progression\u2011free survival of 5.6\u202fmonths when used after radiation, with acceptable toxicity when dose\u2011reduced in combination regimens.",
      "question": "What is the recommended total daily oral dose of paxalisib for this patient, taking into account his BSA of 0.85\u202fm\u00b2 and the required 25% dose reduction due to concurrent panobinostat therapy?",

Calculate the amount for one dose: 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 \u00d7 0.85\u202fm\u00b2 = 17\u202fmg per dose.\n3. Paxalisib is to be given twice daily, so the standard total daily dose would be 17\u202fmg \u00d7 2 = 34\u202fmg.\n4. Because the patient is concurrently receiving panobinostat at the full protocol dose and has experienced grade\u202f2 fatigue, the trial protocol requires a 25% reduction of the paxalisib total daily dose.\n5. Apply the 25% reduction: 34\u202fmg \u00d7 (1\u202f\u2212\u202f0.25) = 34\u202fmg \u00d7 0.75 = 25.5\u202fmg.\n6.

Two weeks after completing radiotherapy, the patient was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial (NCT04567890) evaluating the combination of oral ONC201 at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 once daily and intravenous panobinostat at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 once weekly. The protocol mandated imaging at week\u202f8. At that time, repeat MRI showed a 30\u202f% reduction in the T2 hyperintense tumor volume compared with baseline, but cerebrospinal fluid cytology revealed persistent malignant cells. The patient experienced grade\u202f2 thrombocytopenia (platelet count 85\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L) and grade\u202f1 nausea, both attributed to the study drugs. \n\nBy week\u202f12, the patient exhibited new cranial nerve VI palsy and worsening dysphagia.

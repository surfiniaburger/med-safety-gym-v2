After six cycles, she had a partial response but developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia. The protocol says that for grade \u22653 hematologic toxicity, they hold panobinostat and continue ONC201. So they did that\u2014panobinostat was withheld for two weeks until platelets recovered. Then she continued ONC201 alone for two more cycles (total cycle 8). At cycle 8, MRI showed a 15% increase in tumor volume, which is disease progression.\n\nNow, the question is, what's the next step according to the protocol? Let me check the context again. The last paragraph says: \"The protocol specifies that if disease progression occurs after resolution of prior hematologic toxicity, panobinostat may be re-introduced at a reduced dose of 15 mg/m2 weekly, provided the patient remains on ONC201 at the established dose.\"\n\nSo the key points here are: disease progression happened after the hematologic toxicity (thrombocytopenia) had resolved. The protocol allows reintroducing panobinostat at a lower dose (15 instead of 20 mg/m2) while keeping ONC201 going. \n\nI need to make sure that all conditions are met. The prior toxicity (grade 3 thrombocytopenia) was resolved\u2014platelets went back to 150, which is grade 1. Then disease progression occurred at cycle 8.

Therefore, the next step is to restart panobinostat at 15 mg/m2 weekly with ONC201 continuing.\n\nI should look for the exact quote in the context.

Stereotactic biopsy was performed, and histopathology confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with high\u2011grade features. Molecular analysis demonstrated an H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B, a co\u2011occurring ACVR1 G328V activating mutation, and wild\u2011type TP53.\n\nThe patient was enrolled in a Phase\u202fI/II clinical trial evaluating the combination of ONC201 and panobinostat. She received ONC201 orally at 125\u202fmg/m2 once daily and panobinostat intravenously at 20\u202fmg/m2 once weekly. After six treatment cycles, repeat MRI showed a partial response defined as a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume.

According to the trial protocol, grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 hematologic toxicity mandates holding panobinostat while continuing ONC201 at the same dose.\n\nPanobinostat was withheld for two weeks, after which platelet counts recovered to 150\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L (grade\u202f1). The patient continued ONC201 monotherapy for an additional two cycles. At the end of cycle\u202f8, MRI demonstrated a 15\u202f% increase in tumor volume compared with the nadir measurement, meeting criteria for disease progression.\n\nThe protocol specifies that if disease progression occurs after resolution of prior hematologic toxicity, panobinostat may be re\u2011introduced at a reduced dose of 15\u202fmg/m2 weekly, provided the patient remains on ONC201 at the established dose.",

So, the user is asking whether ONC201 therapy should be continued, discontinued, or modified based on the trial protocol and the patient's current status.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The patient is a 7-year-old with DIPG, WHO grade IV, with specific mutations. He's on a phase II trial (NCT04056995) involving ONC201, radiotherapy, and panobinostat. After 12 weeks, the MRI shows a 55% reduction in T2 hyperintensity volume, no contrast enhancement. Clinically, gait improved, diplopia resolved, but he has Grade 2 fatigue and mild nausea, attributed to panobinostat. No Grade \u22653 adverse events.\n\nThe trial protocol says continuation of ONC201 is allowed if no radiographic progression (\u226525% increase in T2 volume) and \u2264 Grade 2 toxicity. Discontinuation is required if progression or Grade \u22653 toxicity. Also, patients with \u226550% volume reduction at 12 weeks are \"radiographic responders\" and encouraged to stay on therapy up to 24 months if safety criteria are met.\n\nSo, the patient has a 55% reduction, which is \u226550%, so he's a radiographic responder. His toxicity is Grade 2 (fatigue and nausea), which is \u2264 Grade 2. No progression since volume decreased. Therefore, according to the protocol, he should continue ONC201. The panobinostat was part of the initial combo but after radiotherapy, he's on ONC201 monotherapy. The adverse events are from panobinostat, but since he's now on monotherapy, maybe those side effects are resolving? Wait, the context says after completing radiotherapy, he continued ONC201 monotherapy. The 12-week follow-up is after completing radiotherapy, so panobinostat was only during the radiotherapy phase? Wait, the protocol says panobinostat was administered on days 1,8,15 of each 28-day cycle concurrently with radiotherapy. After radiotherapy, he's on ONC201 alone. So at 12-week follow-up, he's probably off panobinostat, but the side effects (Grade 2 fatigue and nausea) were attributed to panobinostat and managed. Since he's now on ONC201 monotherapy, maybe those side effects are no longer an issue, but the protocol states that continuation requires \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity. The current toxicity is Grade 2 but attributed to panobinostat, which he's no longer taking. However, the question is about the current status at 12 weeks. The adverse events were reported at 12-week follow-up, but if panobinostat was stopped after radiotherapy (which was completed before the 12-week scan), then the current toxicity might still be lingering. But the protocol says \"in the presence of \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity\". The treatment now is ONC201 monotherapy. The fatigue and nausea were attributed to panobinostat, so maybe they are not considered treatment-related to ONC201. However, the protocol might consider any toxicity during the treatment period. Wait, the trial protocol specifies continuation criteria as absence of progression and \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity. The patient's current toxicity is Grade 2, but if it's due to panobinostat which is no longer part of the regimen, then maybe the toxicity related to ONC201 is lower. However, the context states \"he reported Grade 2 fatigue and occasional mild nausea, which were attributed to panobinostat\". So the current toxicity is from panobinostat, not ONC201. Since he's now on ONC201 monotherapy, the ongoing toxicity might be resolving, but at the 12-week mark, he still has Grade 2. However, the protocol's continuation criteria are based on treatment-related toxicity. If the toxicity is attributed to panobinostat, which is no longer being administered, then perhaps the toxicity related to the current treatment (ONC201) is acceptable. But the protocol might not distinguish between agents; it's about any treatment-related toxicity in the regimen. Wait, after radiotherapy, he's on ONC201 alone, so the current treatment is ONC201. The adverse events were attributed to panobinostat, which he's not taking anymore. Therefore, the current treatment (ONC201) might not be causing Grade \u22653 toxicity. The protocol says \"in the presence of \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity\". Since the Grade 2 toxicity is due to a drug he's no longer on, perhaps the toxicity related to ONC201 is lower. However, the question states \"current clinical and radiographic status\" at 12-week follow-up. At that time, he has Grade 2 fatigue and nausea, but they are attributed to panobinostat. The protocol's discontinuation is if Grade \u22653 toxicity occurs. Since his current toxicity is Grade 2 and not \u22653, and it's possibly resolving as panobinostat is stopped, the criteria for continuation are met: no progression (55% reduction, which is way below the 25% increase threshold), and toxicity \u2264 Grade 2. Also, he's a radiographic responder (\u226550% reduction), so the protocol encourages continuing up to 24 months. Therefore, ONC201 should be continued.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"The trial protocol specifies that continuation of ONC201 is permitted in the absence of radiographic progression (defined as \u2265 25 % increase in T2-weighted tumor volume) and in the presence of \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity. Discontinuation is mandated if disease progression is observed on MRI or if Grade \u2265 3 toxicity occurs. The investigators also noted that patients achieving \u2265 50 % reduction in tumor volume at 12 weeks are considered \u201cradiographic responders\u201d and are encouraged to remain on therapy for up to 24 months provided safety criteria are met.\"\n\n\"At the 12-week follow-up MRI, the T2 hyperintensity demonstrated a 55 % reduction in volume compared with baseline, and contrast enhancement was no longer appreciable.

The patient achieved a 55% reduction in tumor volume (meeting the \"radiographic responder\" threshold of \u226550%), shows no radiographic progression (which requires \u226525% volume increase), and has only Grade 2 toxicity (fatigue/nausea attributed to panobinostat, not ONC201 monotherapy). The protocol explicitly permits continuation in this scenario and encourages ongoing therapy for up to 24 months for radiographic responders meeting safety criteria.\n</answer>",

Discontinuation is required if progression or Grade \u22653 toxicity. Also, patients with \u226550% volume reduction at 12 weeks are \"radiographic responders\" and encouraged to stay on therapy up to 24 months if safety criteria are met.\n\nSo, the patient has a 55% reduction, which is \u226550%, so he's a radiographic responder. His toxicity is Grade 2 (fatigue and nausea), which is \u2264 Grade 2. No progression since volume decreased. Therefore, according to the protocol, he should continue ONC201. The panobinostat was part of the initial combo but after radiotherapy, he's on ONC201 monotherapy. The adverse events are from panobinostat, but since he's now on monotherapy, maybe those side effects are resolving? Wait, the context says after completing radiotherapy, he continued ONC201 monotherapy. The 12-week follow-up is after completing radiotherapy, so panobinostat was only during the radiotherapy phase? Wait, the protocol says panobinostat was administered on days 1,8,15 of each 28-day cycle concurrently with radiotherapy. After radiotherapy, he's on ONC201 alone. So at 12-week follow-up, he's probably off panobinostat, but the side effects (Grade 2 fatigue and nausea) were attributed to panobinostat and managed. Since he's now on ONC201 monotherapy, maybe those side effects are no longer an issue, but the protocol states that continuation requires \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity. The current toxicity is Grade 2 but attributed to panobinostat, which he's no longer taking. However, the question is about the current status at 12 weeks. The adverse events were reported at 12-week follow-up, but if panobinostat was stopped after radiotherapy (which was completed before the 12-week scan), then the current toxicity might still be lingering. But the protocol says \"in the presence of \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity\". The treatment now is ONC201 monotherapy. The fatigue and nausea were attributed to panobinostat, so maybe they are not considered treatment-related to ONC201. However, the protocol might consider any toxicity during the treatment period. Wait, the trial protocol specifies continuation criteria as absence of progression and \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity. The patient's current toxicity is Grade 2, but if it's due to panobinostat which is no longer part of the regimen, then maybe the toxicity related to ONC201 is lower. However, the context states \"he reported Grade 2 fatigue and occasional mild nausea, which were attributed to panobinostat\". So the current toxicity is from panobinostat, not ONC201. Since he's now on ONC201 monotherapy, the ongoing toxicity might be resolving, but at the 12-week mark, he still has Grade 2. However, the protocol's continuation criteria are based on treatment-related toxicity. If the toxicity is attributed to panobinostat, which is no longer being administered, then perhaps the toxicity related to the current treatment (ONC201) is acceptable. But the protocol might not distinguish between agents; it's about any treatment-related toxicity in the regimen. Wait, after radiotherapy, he's on ONC201 alone, so the current treatment is ONC201. The adverse events were attributed to panobinostat, which he's not taking anymore. Therefore, the current treatment (ONC201) might not be causing Grade \u22653 toxicity. The protocol says \"in the presence of \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity\". Since the Grade 2 toxicity is due to a drug he's no longer on, perhaps the toxicity related to ONC201 is lower. However, the question states \"current clinical and radiographic status\" at 12-week follow-up. At that time, he has Grade 2 fatigue and nausea, but they are attributed to panobinostat. The protocol's discontinuation is if Grade \u22653 toxicity occurs. Since his current toxicity is Grade 2 and not \u22653, and it's possibly resolving as panobinostat is stopped, the criteria for continuation are met: no progression (55% reduction, which is way below the 25% increase threshold), and toxicity \u2264 Grade 2. Also, he's a radiographic responder (\u226550% reduction), so the protocol encourages continuing up to 24 months. Therefore, ONC201 should be continued.",
                  "proof": "\"The trial protocol specifies that continuation of ONC201 is permitted in the absence of radiographic progression (defined as \u2265 25 % increase in T2-weighted tumor volume) and in the presence of \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity. Discontinuation is mandated if disease progression is observed on MRI or if Grade \u2265 3 toxicity occurs. The investigators also noted that patients achieving \u2265 50 % reduction in tumor volume at 12 weeks are considered \u201cradiographic responders\u201d and are encouraged to remain on therapy for up to 24 months provided safety criteria are met.\"\n\n\"At the 12-week follow-up MRI, the T2 hyperintensity demonstrated a 55 % reduction in volume compared with baseline, and contrast enhancement was no longer appreciable.

So, the user is asking whether ONC201 therapy should be continued, discontinued, or modified based on the trial protocol and the patient's current status.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The patient is a 7-year-old with DIPG, WHO grade IV, with specific mutations. He's on a phase II trial (NCT04056995) involving ONC201, radiotherapy, and panobinostat. After 12 weeks, the MRI shows a 55% reduction in T2 hyperintensity volume, no contrast enhancement. Clinically, gait improved, diplopia resolved, but he has Grade 2 fatigue and mild nausea, attributed to panobinostat. No Grade \u22653 adverse events.\n\nThe trial protocol says continuation of ONC201 is allowed if no radiographic progression (\u226525% increase in T2 volume) and \u2264 Grade 2 toxicity. Discontinuation is required if progression or Grade \u22653 toxicity. Also, patients with \u226550% volume reduction at 12 weeks are \"radiographic responders\" and encouraged to stay on therapy up to 24 months if safety criteria are met.\n\nSo, the patient has a 55% reduction, which is \u226550%, so he's a radiographic responder. His toxicity is Grade 2 (fatigue and nausea), which is \u2264 Grade 2. No progression since volume decreased. Therefore, according to the protocol, he should continue ONC201. The panobinostat was part of the initial combo but after radiotherapy, he's on ONC201 monotherapy. The adverse events are from panobinostat, but since he's now on monotherapy, maybe those side effects are resolving? Wait, the context says after completing radiotherapy, he continued ONC201 monotherapy. The 12-week follow-up is after completing radiotherapy, so panobinostat was only during the radiotherapy phase? Wait, the protocol says panobinostat was administered on days 1,8,15 of each 28-day cycle concurrently with radiotherapy. After radiotherapy, he's on ONC201 alone. So at 12-week follow-up, he's probably off panobinostat, but the side effects (Grade 2 fatigue and nausea) were attributed to panobinostat and managed. Since he's now on ONC201 monotherapy, maybe those side effects are no longer an issue, but the protocol states that continuation requires \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity. The current toxicity is Grade 2 but attributed to panobinostat, which he's no longer taking. However, the question is about the current status at 12 weeks. The adverse events were reported at 12-week follow-up, but if panobinostat was stopped after radiotherapy (which was completed before the 12-week scan), then the current toxicity might still be lingering. But the protocol says \"in the presence of \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity\". The treatment now is ONC201 monotherapy. The fatigue and nausea were attributed to panobinostat, so maybe they are not considered treatment-related to ONC201. However, the protocol might consider any toxicity during the treatment period. Wait, the trial protocol specifies continuation criteria as absence of progression and \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity. The patient's current toxicity is Grade 2, but if it's due to panobinostat which is no longer part of the regimen, then maybe the toxicity related to ONC201 is lower. However, the context states \"he reported Grade 2 fatigue and occasional mild nausea, which were attributed to panobinostat\". So the current toxicity is from panobinostat, not ONC201. Since he's now on ONC201 monotherapy, the ongoing toxicity might be resolving, but at the 12-week mark, he still has Grade 2. However, the protocol's continuation criteria are based on treatment-related toxicity. If the toxicity is attributed to panobinostat, which is no longer being administered, then perhaps the toxicity related to the current treatment (ONC201) is acceptable. But the protocol might not distinguish between agents; it's about any treatment-related toxicity in the regimen. Wait, after radiotherapy, he's on ONC201 alone, so the current treatment is ONC201. The adverse events were attributed to panobinostat, which he's not taking anymore. Therefore, the current treatment (ONC201) might not be causing Grade \u22653 toxicity. The protocol says \"in the presence of \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity\". Since the Grade 2 toxicity is due to a drug he's no longer on, perhaps the toxicity related to ONC201 is lower. However, the question states \"current clinical and radiographic status\" at 12-week follow-up. At that time, he has Grade 2 fatigue and nausea, but they are attributed to panobinostat. The protocol's discontinuation is if Grade \u22653 toxicity occurs. Since his current toxicity is Grade 2 and not \u22653, and it's possibly resolving as panobinostat is stopped, the criteria for continuation are met: no progression (55% reduction, which is way below the 25% increase threshold), and toxicity \u2264 Grade 2. Also, he's a radiographic responder (\u226550% reduction), so the protocol encourages continuing up to 24 months. Therefore, ONC201 should be continued.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"The trial protocol specifies that continuation of ONC201 is permitted in the absence of radiographic progression (defined as \u2265 25 % increase in T2-weighted tumor volume) and in the presence of \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity. Discontinuation is mandated if disease progression is observed on MRI or if Grade \u2265 3 toxicity occurs. The investigators also noted that patients achieving \u2265 50 % reduction in tumor volume at 12 weeks are considered \u201cradiographic responders\u201d and are encouraged to remain on therapy for up to 24 months provided safety criteria are met.\"\n\n\"At the 12-week follow-up MRI, the T2 hyperintensity demonstrated a 55 % reduction in volume compared with baseline, and contrast enhancement was no longer appreciable.

His toxicity is Grade 2 (fatigue and nausea), which is \u2264 Grade 2. No progression since volume decreased. Therefore, according to the protocol, he should continue ONC201. The panobinostat was part of the initial combo but after radiotherapy, he's on ONC201 monotherapy. The adverse events are from panobinostat, but since he's now on monotherapy, maybe those side effects are resolving? Wait, the context says after completing radiotherapy, he continued ONC201 monotherapy. The 12-week follow-up is after completing radiotherapy, so panobinostat was only during the radiotherapy phase? Wait, the protocol says panobinostat was administered on days 1,8,15 of each 28-day cycle concurrently with radiotherapy. After radiotherapy, he's on ONC201 alone. So at 12-week follow-up, he's probably off panobinostat, but the side effects (Grade 2 fatigue and nausea) were attributed to panobinostat and managed. Since he's now on ONC201 monotherapy, maybe those side effects are no longer an issue, but the protocol states that continuation requires \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity. The current toxicity is Grade 2 but attributed to panobinostat, which he's no longer taking. However, the question is about the current status at 12 weeks. The adverse events were reported at 12-week follow-up, but if panobinostat was stopped after radiotherapy (which was completed before the 12-week scan), then the current toxicity might still be lingering. But the protocol says \"in the presence of \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity\". The treatment now is ONC201 monotherapy. The fatigue and nausea were attributed to panobinostat, so maybe they are not considered treatment-related to ONC201. However, the protocol might consider any toxicity during the treatment period. Wait, the trial protocol specifies continuation criteria as absence of progression and \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity. The patient's current toxicity is Grade 2, but if it's due to panobinostat which is no longer part of the regimen, then maybe the toxicity related to ONC201 is lower. However, the context states \"he reported Grade 2 fatigue and occasional mild nausea, which were attributed to panobinostat\". So the current toxicity is from panobinostat, not ONC201. Since he's now on ONC201 monotherapy, the ongoing toxicity might be resolving, but at the 12-week mark, he still has Grade 2. However, the protocol's continuation criteria are based on treatment-related toxicity. If the toxicity is attributed to panobinostat, which is no longer being administered, then perhaps the toxicity related to the current treatment (ONC201) is acceptable. But the protocol might not distinguish between agents; it's about any treatment-related toxicity in the regimen. Wait, after radiotherapy, he's on ONC201 alone, so the current treatment is ONC201. The adverse events were attributed to panobinostat, which he's not taking anymore. Therefore, the current treatment (ONC201) might not be causing Grade \u22653 toxicity. The protocol says \"in the presence of \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity\". Since the Grade 2 toxicity is due to a drug he's no longer on, perhaps the toxicity related to ONC201 is lower. However, the question states \"current clinical and radiographic status\" at 12-week follow-up. At that time, he has Grade 2 fatigue and nausea, but they are attributed to panobinostat. The protocol's discontinuation is if Grade \u22653 toxicity occurs. Since his current toxicity is Grade 2 and not \u22653, and it's possibly resolving as panobinostat is stopped, the criteria for continuation are met: no progression (55% reduction, which is way below the 25% increase threshold), and toxicity \u2264 Grade 2. Also, he's a radiographic responder (\u226550% reduction), so the protocol encourages continuing up to 24 months. Therefore, ONC201 should be continued.",
                "proof": "\"The trial protocol specifies that continuation of ONC201 is permitted in the absence of radiographic progression (defined as \u2265 25 % increase in T2-weighted tumor volume) and in the presence of \u2264 Grade 2 treatment-related toxicity. Discontinuation is mandated if disease progression is observed on MRI or if Grade \u2265 3 toxicity occurs. The investigators also noted that patients achieving \u2265 50 % reduction in tumor volume at 12 weeks are considered \u201cradiographic responders\u201d and are encouraged to remain on therapy for up to 24 months provided safety criteria are met.\"\n\n\"At the 12-week follow-up MRI, the T2 hyperintensity demonstrated a 55 % reduction in volume compared with baseline, and contrast enhancement was no longer appreciable. Clinically, the patient\u2019s gait had improved, and diplopia resolved; however, he reported Grade 2 fatigue and occasional mild nausea, which were attributed to panobinostat and managed with supportive care. No Grade \u2265 3 adverse events were recorded.\"",
                "final": "ONC201 therapy should be continued. The patient achieved a 55% reduction in tumor volume (meeting the \"radiographic responder\" threshold of \u226550%), shows no radiographic progression (which requires \u226525% volume increase), and has only Grade 2 toxicity (fatigue/nausea attributed to panobinostat, not ONC201 monotherapy). The protocol explicitly permits continuation in this scenario and encourages ongoing therapy for up to 24 months for radiographic responders meeting safety criteria.",

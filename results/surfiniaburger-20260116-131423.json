MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse, infiltrative lesion centered in the pons, measuring 3.2\u202fcm in greatest dimension, with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and minimal contrast enhancement. An image\u2011guided stereotactic biopsy was performed. Histopathology confirmed a World Health Organization grade\u202fIV diffuse midline glioma. Molecular profiling demonstrated the canonical H3F3A K27M mutation, a concurrent TP53 missense mutation (R175H), and high\u2011level amplification of PDGFRA (copy number >10). No ACVR1 mutation was detected.\n\nThe patient was enrolled in the multicenter phase\u202fII trial DRAGON\u2011001, which investigated concurrent radiation therapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) with the oral small\u2011molecule ONC201 (150\u202fmg/m\u00b2 once daily). After 6\u202fweeks of combined treatment, repeat MRI showed a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume, meeting criteria for a partial response. However, at the 4\u2011month follow\u2011up, the lesion demonstrated progression with a 25\u202f% increase in volume compared with the nadir.\n\nThe DRAGON\u2011001 trial reported a median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 5.2\u202fmonths for patients with H3K27M\u2011mutated DIPG, compared with historical controls of 3.1\u202fmonths, and grade\u202f2 thrombocytopenia was the most common adverse event (observed in 18\u202f% of participants).\n\nFollowing progression, the patient entered a compassionate\u2011use protocol for an H3K27M peptide vaccine (0.5\u202fmg subcutaneously weekly for 12\u202fweeks). The vaccine was well tolerated, and subsequent imaging demonstrated stable disease for an additional 3\u202fmonths.\n\nGiven the PDGFRA amplification, the treating team considered enrollment in an ongoing phase\u202fII study of crenolanib, a selective PDGFRA/B tyrosine\u2011kinase inhibitor administered at 150\u202fmg orally twice daily. Preliminary data from that study indicated a median overall survival of 12.4\u202fmonths in PDGFRA\u2011amplified DIPG patients versus 10.3\u202fmonths in historical controls, representing a 2\u2011month survival advantage.\n\nThe family inquires about the most appropriate next targeted therapy based on the child's molecular profile and treatment history.",

MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse, infiltrative lesion centered in the pons, measuring 3.2\u202fcm in greatest dimension, with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and minimal contrast enhancement. An image\u2011guided stereotactic biopsy was performed. Histopathology confirmed a World Health Organization grade\u202fIV diffuse midline glioma. Molecular profiling demonstrated the canonical H3F3A K27M mutation, a concurrent TP53 missense mutation (R175H), and high\u2011level amplification of PDGFRA (copy number >10). No ACVR1 mutation was detected.\n\nThe patient was enrolled in the multicenter phase\u202fII trial DRAGON\u2011001, which investigated concurrent radiation therapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) with the oral small\u2011molecule ONC201 (150\u202fmg/m\u00b2 once daily). After 6\u202fweeks of combined treatment, repeat MRI showed a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume, meeting criteria for a partial response. However, at the 4\u2011month follow\u2011up, the lesion demonstrated progression with a 25\u202f% increase in volume compared with the nadir.\n\nThe DRAGON\u2011001 trial reported a median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 5.2\u202fmonths for patients with H3K27M\u2011mutated DIPG, compared with historical controls of 3.1\u202fmonths, and grade\u202f2 thrombocytopenia was the most common adverse event (observed in 18\u202f% of participants).\n\nFollowing progression, the patient entered a compassionate\u2011use protocol for an H3K27M peptide vaccine (0.5\u202fmg subcutaneously weekly for 12\u202fweeks). The vaccine was well tolerated, and subsequent imaging demonstrated stable disease for an additional 3\u202fmonths.\n\nGiven the PDGFRA amplification, the treating team considered enrollment in an ongoing phase\u202fII study of crenolanib, a selective PDGFRA/B tyrosine\u2011kinase inhibitor administered at 150\u202fmg orally twice daily. Preliminary data from that study indicated a median overall survival of 12.4\u202fmonths in PDGFRA\u2011amplified DIPG patients versus 10.3\u202fmonths in historical controls, representing a 2\u2011month survival advantage.\n\nThe family inquires about the most appropriate next targeted therapy based on the child's molecular profile and treatment history.",

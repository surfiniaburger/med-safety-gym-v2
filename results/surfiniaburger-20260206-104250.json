After completing radiation, he started the trial drugs. At the 8-week check, his platelet count is 82, which is grade 2 thrombocytopenia. The question is, what's the next step for managing this, and should the doses be adjusted?\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The key part here is the trial's safety management guidelines. The context says: \"According to the trial\u2019s safety management guidelines, dose modifications are required for grade \u22653 hematologic toxicities, whereas grade\u202f1\u20132 toxicities are managed with close monitoring without mandatory dose reduction.\"\n\nSo, grade 2 thrombocytopenia falls under grade 1-2. The guidelines state that for these grades, they don't require dose modifications. Instead, they should be managed with close monitoring and no mandatory dose reduction.\n\nThe patient's platelet count is 82, which is grade 2 (since CTCAE v5.0 defines grade 2 as 50-74 x10^9/L? Wait, wait, no. Wait, CTCAE v5.0 for thrombocytopenia: Grade 1 is 75-99, Grade 2 is 50-74, Grade 3 is 25-49, Grade 4 is <25. Wait, but the context says platelet count is 82, which would be Grade 1. Wait, but the context says \"platelet count of 82 \u00d7 10\u2079/L, consistent with grade 2 thrombocytopenia (CTCAE v5.0).\" Hmm, maybe I'm misremembering the CTCAE grades. Let me check.\n\nWait, according to CTCAE v5.0, thrombocytopenia:\n\nGrade 1: 75,000 to <100,000\n\nGrade 2: 50,000 to <75,000\n\nGrade 3: 25,000 to <50,000\n\nGrade 4: <25,000\n\nBut the patient's platelet count is 82, which is 82 x10^9/L, so 82,000. That would be Grade 1, since 75-99 is Grade 1. But the context says it's grade 2. Wait, maybe there's a typo, but according to the context, they state it's grade 2. Wait, the context says: \"platelet count of 82 \u00d7 10\u2079/L, consistent with grade 2 thrombocytopenia (CTCAE v5.0).\" So regardless of actual CTCAE, in the context they say it's grade 2. So we have to go with that. Maybe the CTCAE criteria here is different, but the context explicitly states it's grade 2.\n\nSo, the trial's guidelines say grade 1-2 toxicities are managed with close monitoring without mandatory dose reduction. Therefore, the next step is to continue close monitoring and not adjust the doses.\n\nThe question asks for the most appropriate next management step and whether dosing should be adjusted. Based on the context, since it's grade 2, no dose adjustment is needed, just monitoring.\n\nSo the answer should be that no dose adjustment is required, and continue with close monitoring.\n\n</think>\n\n\n<proof>\n\"According to the trial\u2019s safety management guidelines, dose modifications are required for grade \u22653 hematologic toxicities, whereas grade\u202f1\u20132 toxicities are managed with close monitoring without mandatory dose reduction.\"\n</proof>\n<answer>\nThe most appropriate next management step is continued close monitoring without dose adjustment of ONC201 or everolimus, as grade 2 thrombocytopenia falls under grade 1\u20132 toxicities which do not require mandatory dose reduction per the trial protocol.\n</answer>",

MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine lesion measuring 3.5 cm with classic T2 hyperintensity and minimal contrast enhancement. Histone H3 K27M mutation was confirmed by sequencing, and an additional ACVR1 G328V mutation was identified. Germline testing showed a heterozygous TP53 R175H variant. He completed standard focal radiotherapy (54 Gy in 30 fractions) over six weeks. Two weeks after completing radiation, he was enrolled in a phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the combination of ONC201 and everolimus for H3 K27M\u2011mutant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). The trial protocol specified ONC201 625\u202fmg orally once weekly and everolimus 5\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily. At the 8\u2011week safety assessment, laboratory studies demonstrated a platelet count of 82\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L, consistent with grade 2 thrombocytopenia (CTCAE v5.0). No other hematologic toxicities were noted. MRI at the same visit showed a 30\u202f% reduction in the T2 hyperintense tumor volume compared with baseline, and the patient\u2019s neurologic status remained stable. The trial\u2019s interim report indicated an overall response rate of 25\u202f% in H3 K27M\u2011mutated DIPG, a median progression\u2011free survival of 5.2\u202fmonths, and a median overall survival of 9.8\u202fmonths.

The question is, what's the next step for managing this, and should the doses be adjusted?\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The key part here is the trial's safety management guidelines. The context says: \"According to the trial\u2019s safety management guidelines, dose modifications are required for grade \u22653 hematologic toxicities, whereas grade\u202f1\u20132 toxicities are managed with close monitoring without mandatory dose reduction.\"\n\nSo, grade 2 thrombocytopenia falls under grade 1-2. The guidelines state that for these grades, they don't require dose modifications. Instead, they should be managed with close monitoring and no mandatory dose reduction.\n\nThe patient's platelet count is 82, which is grade 2 (since CTCAE v5.0 defines grade 2 as 50-74 x10^9/L?

Wait, but the context says \"platelet count of 82 \u00d7 10\u2079/L, consistent with grade 2 thrombocytopenia (CTCAE v5.0).\" Hmm, maybe I'm misremembering the CTCAE grades.

That would be Grade 1, since 75-99 is Grade 1. But the context says it's grade 2. Wait, maybe there's a typo, but according to the context, they state it's grade 2. Wait, the context says: \"platelet count of 82 \u00d7 10\u2079/L, consistent with grade 2 thrombocytopenia (CTCAE v5.0).\" So regardless of actual CTCAE, in the context they say it's grade 2. So we have to go with that. Maybe the CTCAE criteria here is different, but the context explicitly states it's grade 2.\n\nSo, the trial's guidelines say grade 1-2 toxicities are managed with close monitoring without mandatory dose reduction. Therefore, the next step is to continue close monitoring and not adjust the doses.\n\nThe question asks for the most appropriate next management step and whether dosing should be adjusted.

Histone H3 K27M mutation was confirmed by sequencing, and an additional ACVR1 G328V mutation was identified. Germline testing showed a heterozygous TP53 R175H variant. He completed standard focal radiotherapy (54 Gy in 30 fractions) over six weeks. Two weeks after completing radiation, he was enrolled in a phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the combination of ONC201 and everolimus for H3 K27M\u2011mutant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). The trial protocol specified ONC201 625\u202fmg orally once weekly and everolimus 5\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily.

No other hematologic toxicities were noted. MRI at the same visit showed a 30\u202f% reduction in the T2 hyperintense tumor volume compared with baseline, and the patient\u2019s neurologic status remained stable.

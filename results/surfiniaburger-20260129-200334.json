Histopathology after stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV.

The context says the trial requires: (1) no prior exposure to panobinostat, (2) no active infection at enrollment, and (3) adequate organ function. \n\nThe patient hasn't received panobinostat yet, so that's good for criterion 1.

So, the active infection would disqualify them from the trial right now.\n\nNext, the immediate therapeutic step. The options mentioned are panobinostat and the bispecific antibody trial. But since the patient can't enroll in the trial due to the active infection, maybe they should treat the infection first. However, panobinostat is contraindicated if QTc >450ms, but the patient's QTc is 440ms, which is under 450. Wait, but there's an adenovirus infection.

However, panobinostat is available, but is it appropriate now?\n\nWait, panobinostat's contraindication is QTc >450ms. The patient's QTc is 440ms, which is okay. But the adenovirus infection\u2014does that affect panobinostat use? The context doesn't say panobinostat is contraindicated in infections, only the QTc issue. So maybe they could use panobinostat now, but the trial requires no prior panobinostat. If they use panobinostat, they can't join the trial later. But the trial also requires no active infection, so if they treat the infection first, maybe they can join the trial without using panobinostat.\n\nWait, the adenovirus is a mild active infection.

Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling showed an H3\u2011K27M mutation, PDGFRA amplification (copy number 7), and a germline MLH1 pathogenic variant consistent with mismatch\u2011repair deficiency (MMR\u2011D). \n\nShe was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII DIPG\u2011ONC201 trial (NCT04534567).

The context says the trial requires: (1) no prior exposure to panobinostat, (2) no active infection at enrollment, and (3) adequate organ function. \n\nThe patient hasn't received panobinostat yet, so that's good for criterion 1.

So, the active infection would disqualify them from the trial right now.\n\nNext, the immediate therapeutic step. The options mentioned are panobinostat and the bispecific antibody trial. But since the patient can't enroll in the trial due to the active infection, maybe they should treat the infection first. However, panobinostat is contraindicated if QTc >450ms, but the patient's QTc is 440ms, which is under 450. Wait, but there's an adenovirus infection.

Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling showed an H3\u2011K27M mutation, PDGFRA amplification (copy number 7), and a germline MLH1 pathogenic variant consistent with mismatch\u2011repair deficiency (MMR\u2011D). \n\nShe was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII DIPG\u2011ONC201 trial (NCT04534567). The protocol mandated focal conformal radiation therapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) combined with oral ONC201 at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered twice weekly, starting on day\u202f1 of radiation. After 6\u202fweeks of combined therapy, MRI demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume, and the patient\u2019s neurological exam improved. However, at month\u202f9 post\u2011diagnosis (3\u202fmonths after completing radiation), repeat imaging showed new contrast\u2011enhancing foci and increased T2 signal, indicating disease progression despite ongoing ONC201 (which was continued at the same dose). \n\nThe trial\u2019s historical control arm (radiation\u202f+\u202ftemozolomide) reported a median overall survival (OS) of 12\u202fmonths, whereas the ONC201 arm showed a median OS of 18\u202fmonths (p\u202f=\u202f0.04).

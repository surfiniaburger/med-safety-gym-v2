He tolerated ONC201 well, with only grade\u202f1 fatigue and transient nausea.\n\nAfter six cycles of ONC201 (approximately 6\u202fmonths from trial entry), surveillance MRI revealed new areas of contrast enhancement at the dorsolateral pons and a modest increase in overall tumor size (approximately 10\u202f% growth from nadir), indicating disease progression despite ongoing therapy.

The user is asking for the appropriate radiation dose in Gy for a 7-year-old child diagnosed with what's likely a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided context. The MRI shows a brainstem lesion from midbrain to medulla, consistent with DIPG. The biopsy confirms a high-grade astrocytic neoplasm with H3-K27M mutation, which is typical for DIPG. However, the pathology report mentions possible sampling issues, and there's uncertainty about a supratentorial lesion.\n\nThe key part here is the treatment recommendations. The oncology notes mention considering palliative care if DIPG is confirmed, but also suggest a clinical trial for high-grade pediatric glioma if the mutation is positive. The neurosurgery consult recommends palliative care if DIPG is confirmed but also mentions clinical trials.\n\nNow, the question is about the radiation dose. Standard treatment for DIPG is radiation therapy, typically 54-60 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions. But the context doesn't specify any exact dose. Let me check the context again.\n\nLooking through the context: \"No specific treatment plan or radiation dosing is documented in any of the notes.\" Oh, right! The last sentence says that. So there's no mention of the actual dose in the provided information. The oncology and neurosurgery notes talk about considering palliative care or clinical trials but don't state the dose.\n\nSince the context explicitly states that no radiation dosing is documented, I can't pull a quote that specifies the dose. The user is asking for the appropriate dose, but according to the context, it's not provided. Therefore, the answer should be that the context doesn't specify the dose.

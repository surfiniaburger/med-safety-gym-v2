MRI of the brain showed a diffuse, infiltrative lesion centered in the pons, measuring 3.2\u202fcm in greatest dimension, with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and mild contrast enhancement. She underwent a stereotactic biopsy, and molecular profiling revealed an H3\u2011K27M mutation (histone H3.3) and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V mutation; no BRAF V600E mutation was detected. Baseline laboratory studies were within normal limits except for a hemoglobin of 12.1\u202fg/dL and platelet count of 210\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L. Her performance status was Karnofsky 80.\n\nThe patient received standard focal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks) without concurrent chemotherapy. Four weeks after completing radiation, she was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial evaluating the combination of panobinostat and ONC201. Panobinostat was administered orally at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), and ONC201 was given orally at 625\u202fmg once weekly. She tolerated the regimen well, with the only notable adverse event being Grade\u202f2 thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir 85\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L) that resolved without dose modification. Serial MRIs at 8\u2011 and 12\u2011week intervals demonstrated stable disease.\n\nAt the 4\u2011month assessment (approximately 16\u202fweeks after trial initiation), repeat MRI revealed new, focal enhancing nodules within the pons and extension into the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, consistent with disease progression. The treating team discontinued the investigational regimen. Given the lack of FDA\u2011approved targeted therapies for H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, the oncologist reviewed available options. Temozolomide is FDA\u2011approved for adult high\u2011grade glioma but has limited efficacy in pediatric DIPG and was previously considered unsuitable due to the patient\u2019s prior radiation and modest hematologic reserve. A separate phase\u202fI/II trial investigating the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat (800\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily) in H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant pediatric gliomas is currently recruiting and permits enrollment of patients who have progressed after radiation and a prior investigational agent. No other active trials targeting ACVR1 mutations were available in the region.\n\nThe family wishes to pursue the most evidence\u2011based, mutation\u2011directed therapy while minimizing further hematologic toxicity.",

Assess FDA\u2011approved options: no FDA\u2011approved targeted drug exists for H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant DIPG; temozolomide is approved for adult glioma but has limited pediatric benefit and would add hematologic risk.\n4.

Consider safety: the patient previously tolerated panobinostat with only Grade\u202f2 thrombocytopenia, suggesting she can handle oral agents; tazemetostat\u2019s safety profile is acceptable and does not markedly exacerbate thrombocytopenia.\n6. Conclude that the most appropriate next step is enrollment in the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat trial, as it targets the underlying H3\u2011K27M\u2011driven epigenetic pathway, aligns with the patient\u2019s mutation status, and is the best evidence\u2011based option given the lack of approved alternatives.\n</think>\n\n<proof>\n- \"Molecular profiling revealed an H3\u2011K27M mutation and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V mutation; no BRAF V600E mutation was detected.\"\n- \"She tolerated the regimen well, with the only notable adverse event being Grade\u202f2 thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir 85\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L) that resolved without dose modification.\"\n- \"At the 4\u2011month assessment ...

MRI of the brain showed a diffuse, infiltrative lesion centered in the pons, measuring 3.2\u202fcm in greatest dimension, with characteristic T2 hyperintensity and mild contrast enhancement. She underwent a stereotactic biopsy, and molecular profiling revealed an H3\u2011K27M mutation (histone H3.3) and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V mutation; no BRAF V600E mutation was detected. Baseline laboratory studies were within normal limits except for a hemoglobin of 12.1\u202fg/dL and platelet count of 210\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L. Her performance status was Karnofsky 80.\n\nThe patient received standard focal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks) without concurrent chemotherapy. Four weeks after completing radiation, she was enrolled in a phase\u202fII clinical trial evaluating the combination of panobinostat and ONC201. Panobinostat was administered orally at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), and ONC201 was given orally at 625\u202fmg once weekly. She tolerated the regimen well, with the only notable adverse event being Grade\u202f2 thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir 85\u202f\u00d710\u2079/L) that resolved without dose modification. Serial MRIs at 8\u2011 and 12\u2011week intervals demonstrated stable disease.\n\nAt the 4\u2011month assessment (approximately 16\u202fweeks after trial initiation), repeat MRI revealed new, focal enhancing nodules within the pons and extension into the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, consistent with disease progression. The treating team discontinued the investigational regimen. Given the lack of FDA\u2011approved targeted therapies for H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, the oncologist reviewed available options. Temozolomide is FDA\u2011approved for adult high\u2011grade glioma but has limited efficacy in pediatric DIPG and was previously considered unsuitable due to the patient\u2019s prior radiation and modest hematologic reserve. A separate phase\u202fI/II trial investigating the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat (800\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily) in H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant pediatric gliomas is currently recruiting and permits enrollment of patients who have progressed after radiation and a prior investigational agent. No other active trials targeting ACVR1 mutations were available in the region.\n\nThe family wishes to pursue the most evidence\u2011based, mutation\u2011directed therapy while minimizing further hematologic toxicity.",

Assess FDA\u2011approved options: no FDA\u2011approved targeted drug exists for H3\u2011K27M\u2011mutant DIPG; temozolomide is approved for adult glioma but has limited pediatric benefit and would add hematologic risk.\n4.

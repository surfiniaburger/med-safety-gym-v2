Molecular profiling of the tumor revealed an H3K27M mutation, an ACVR1 G328V activating mutation, and wild\u2011type TP53. He completed standard focal radiation therapy to a total dose of 54\u202fGy over 6 weeks, concurrently receiving temozolomide at 75\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily. Three months after completing radiation, his disease progressed clinically and radiographically. He was then enrolled in a phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the combination of the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat and the dopamine receptor D2 antagonist ONC201. The trial protocol specified panobinostat at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered orally twice weekly and ONC201 at 125\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered orally once weekly. After two treatment cycles, MRI demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in tumor volume and his neurologic symptoms improved. However, laboratory monitoring revealed grade\u202f3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count 45\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L). The trial\u2019s safety guidelines state that for any grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 hematologic toxicity, panobinostat dose should be reduced to 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 (maintaining the twice\u2011weekly schedule), and that if panobinostat must be discontinued, ONC201 may be continued at the same dose.

MRI demonstrated a diffuse intrinsic pontine lesion measuring 2.8\u202fcm in longitudinal diameter, hyperintense on T2 and non\u2011enhancing on T1 post\u2011contrast. A stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) WHO grade\u202fIV. Molecular profiling revealed the canonical H3K27M mutation in HIST1H3B and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation; MGMT promoter was unmethylated. The patient received standard focal radiation (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions) over 6\u202fweeks, achieving temporary radiographic stabilization. Six weeks after completion of radiation, he was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII \u201cPANO\u2011ONC201\u2011DIPG\u2011A\u201d trial (NCT04047303), which combines oral panobinostat 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 three times weekly and ONC201 125\u202fmg orally once weekly, together with low\u2011dose temozolomide 50\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily for 5 days every 28\u2011day cycle.

MRI of the brain revealed a diffuse intrinsic pontine mass measuring 3.2\u202fcm in the anteroposterior dimension, hyperintense on T2, with minimal contrast enhancement. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed a diffuse midline glioma, WHO grade IV, harboring the H3K27M mutation (K27M substitution in HIST1H3B) and a co\u2011occurring ACVR1 G328V activating mutation. The patient also has a known diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type\u202f1 (NF1) but no other germline alterations. He underwent focal conformal radiation therapy to a total dose of 54\u202fGy delivered in 30 fractions over 6\u202fweeks. Concurrently, he was enrolled in a Phase\u202fI/II clinical trial (NCT04222972) evaluating the combination of ONC201 (a dopamine receptor D2 antagonist) at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered intravenously once weekly and panobinostat (a pan\u2011HDAC inhibitor) at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 given orally three times weekly. At the 8\u2011week post\u2011radiation assessment, repeat MRI demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in the tumor\u2019s T2 hyperintense volume, meeting criteria for a partial radiographic response. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis showed a decline in the H3K27M allele frequency from 12\u202f% at baseline to 4\u202f% after treatment.

Evaluate the safety profile: The patient has experienced no Grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 adverse events and laboratory values remain normal, suggesting the regimen is tolerable.\n3. Consider the trial efficacy data: The combination therapy has demonstrated a statistically significant overall\u2011survival benefit (median OS 14\u202fmonths vs 11\u202fmonths; HR\u202f0.78, p\u202f=\u202f0.04) for H3K27M\u2011mutant DIPG.\n4. Weigh the risk\u2011benefit ratio: Given objective response, decreasing molecular marker, and proven survival advantage with acceptable toxicity, discontinuation would forfeit a potentially life\u2011prolonging benefit.\n5. Determine the next step: Continue the current ONC201\u202f+\u202fpanobinostat regimen at the same dosing schedule and maintain imaging surveillance (e.g., MRI every 8\u202fweeks) to monitor for further response or progression.\n</think>\n\n<proof>\n- \"At the 8\u2011week post\u2011radiation assessment, repeat MRI demonstrated a 30\u202f% reduction in the tumor\u2019s T2 hyperintense volume, meeting criteria for a partial radiographic response.\"\n- \"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis showed a decline in the H3K27M allele frequency from 12\u202f% at baseline to 4\u202f% after treatment.\"\n- \"The trial\u2019s interim analysis reported a median overall survival of 14\u202fmonths for patients with H3K27M\u2011mutant DIPG receiving the ONC201\u202f+\u202fpanobinostat regimen, compared with a historical control median OS of 11\u202fmonths (hazard ratio\u202f0.78, p\u202f=\u202f0.04).\"\n- \"No Grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 toxicities have been observed in this patient to date; laboratory monitoring shows stable liver function tests and no cytopenias.\"\n</proof>\n\n<answer>\nContinue the ONC201 plus panobinostat combination at the current dosing schedule and keep regular MRI surveillance (e.g., every 8\u202fweeks).

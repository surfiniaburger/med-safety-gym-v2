The patient was enrolled in a multicenter Phase\u202fI/II trial (NCT04056995) evaluating the oral small\u2011molecule imipridone ONC201 in combination with standard focal radiation therapy. The trial protocol specified ONC201 dosing at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered orally once daily, beginning on day\u202f1 of radiation.

Histologic confirmation was obtained via stereotactic biopsy, revealing a WHO grade\u202fIV diffuse midline glioma with the following molecular profile: H3K27M\u2011mutant (H3F3A p.K27M), ACVR1\u2011mutant (p.R206H), TP53 wild\u2011type, and MGMT promoter unmethylated.\n\nThe patient was enrolled in the ongoing Phase\u202fII \u201cPAN\u2011ONC\u2011DIPG\u201d trial (NCT04567890), which investigates the combination of the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat and the imipridone ONC201 administered concurrently with standard focal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions). Treatment protocol details:\n- Panobinostat: oral, 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice daily (BID) on days 1\u20115 of each radiotherapy week (total 5\u202fweeks).\n- ONC201: oral, 125\u202fmg once weekly on Fridays, beginning on week\u202f1 of radiotherapy.\n- Radiotherapy: 1.8\u202fGy per fraction, 5\u202fdays/week.\n\nPharmacokinetic monitoring performed at the end of week\u202f4 showed a panobinostat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of 0.48\u202f\u00b5M (target therapeutic CSF level \u22651.0\u202f\u00b5M). No dose\u2011limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed; the highest recorded adverse event was grade\u202f2 nausea, managed with ondansetron.\n\nRadiographic assessments:\n- Baseline MRI (pre\u2011treatment): 3.2\u202fcm lesion, no contrast enhancement.\n- Week\u202f4 MRI (mid\u2011treatment): stable disease; lesion unchanged in size; no new enhancement.\n- Week\u202f8 MRI (post\u2011treatment, 2\u202fweeks after completion of radiotherapy): new T2\u2011hyperintense expansion measuring 3.7\u202fcm (\u224815\u202f% increase in volume) with mild contrast enhancement at the ventral margin, consistent with radiographic progression.\n\nTrial protocol amendment permits dose escalation of panobinostat to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID beginning week\u202f5 if CSF concentrations are <1.0\u202f\u00b5M and the patient has experienced \u2264 grade\u202f2 toxicity. Alternatively, the protocol allows addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (5\u202fmg orally once daily) for patients with documented ACVR1 mutation and sub\u2011therapeutic panobinostat exposure.\n\nOutcome data from the first 12 patients on the trial indicate a median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 6.2\u202fmonths and an overall response rate (ORR) of 25\u202f% (partial responses). The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.",
                "question": "Based on the trial information and the patient\u2019s pharmacokinetic and imaging results, what is the most likely explanation for the radiographic progression observed at week\u202f8, and what adjustment to the therapeutic regimen does the protocol allow to address this issue?",
                "expected_answer": {
                    "final": "<think>\n1. Identify the key data points: the patient has H3K27M and ACVR1 mutations, received panobinostat 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID, and CSF concentration at week\u202f4 was 0.48\u202f\u00b5M, which is below the target therapeutic level of \u22651.0\u202f\u00b5M.\n2. Correlate low CSF concentration with the observed radiographic progression at week\u202f8 (new lesion expansion of \u224815\u202f%). The context explicitly states that early progression in the trial is often due to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, particularly in ACVR1\u2011mutant tumors.\n3. Therefore, the most likely explanation for progression is insufficient panobinostat exposure in the central nervous system, leading to inadequate histone deacetylase inhibition and allowing tumor growth.\n4. Review the protocol\u2019s permitted modifications: if CSF levels are <1.0\u202f\u00b5M and toxicity is \u2264 grade\u202f2, panobinostat dose may be escalated to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID starting week\u202f5; alternatively, everolimus can be added for ACVR1\u2011mutant patients with sub\u2011therapeutic exposure.\n5. Since the patient has only grade\u202f2 nausea (\u2264 grade\u202f2 toxicity) and low CSF levels, the protocol allows dose escalation of panobinostat to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID.\n6. Conclude: the progression is most likely due to sub\u2011therapeutic panobinostat CNS levels, and the appropriate protocol\u2011allowed adjustment is to increase the panobinostat dose to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID.\n</think>\n\n<proof>\n- \"Pharmacokinetic monitoring performed at the end of week\u202f4 showed a panobinostat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of 0.48\u202f\u00b5M (target therapeutic CSF level \u22651.0\u202f\u00b5M).\"\n- \"Week\u202f8 MRI ... new T2\u2011hyperintense expansion measuring 3.7\u202fcm (\u224815\u202f% increase in volume), consistent with radiographic progression.\"\n- \"The most common reason for early progression was attributed to inadequate CNS penetration of panobinostat, especially in cases harboring ACVR1 mutations.\"\n- \"Trial protocol amendment permits dose escalation of panobinostat to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID beginning week\u202f5 if CSF concentrations are <1.0\u202f\u00b5M and the patient has experienced \u2264 grade\u202f2 toxicity.\"\n- \"No dose\u2011limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed; the highest recorded adverse event was grade\u202f2 nausea.\"\n</proof>\n\n<answer>\nThe progression most likely reflects insufficient central\u2011nervous\u2011system exposure to panobinostat (CSF level 0.48\u202f\u00b5M, well below the \u22651.0\u202f\u00b5M target), which allows the tumor to grow despite radiotherapy. Because the patient has only grade\u202f2 toxicity and sub\u2011therapeutic CSF concentrations, the protocol permits escalating panobinostat to 30\u202fmg/m\u00b2 BID starting week\u202f5 to achieve adequate CNS levels.\n</answer>",

Molecular profiling of the biopsy specimen demonstrated a heterozygous H3F3A\u2011K27M mutation and a concurrent ACVR1\u2011R206H activating mutation. Baseline hepatic panel was normal. The patient completed standard focal radiation therapy (54 Gy in 30 fractions) three weeks ago.\n\nBecause of the dual H3\u2011K27M/ACVR1 genotype, the oncology team enrolled him in the multi\u2011center Phase I/II trial NCT04567890, which evaluates the oral DRD2 antagonist ONC201 combined with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. The protocol specifies ONC201 at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered orally once weekly and panobinostat at 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 given orally three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for a 28\u2011day cycle.\n\nInterim analysis of the trial reported that patients with both H3\u2011K27M and ACVR1 mutations who received the combination therapy had a median overall survival (OS) of 13\u202fmonths, compared with 9\u202fmonths for those receiving ONC201 monotherapy (p\u202f=\u202f0.04).\n\nPharmacogenomic testing revealed that the patient carries a CYP3A4*22 loss\u2011of\u2011function allele, which is known to reduce panobinostat clearance by approximately 30\u202f%. The trial protocol includes a dose\u2011modification guideline: for patients with a confirmed CYP3A4 loss\u2011of\u2011function variant, reduce the panobinostat dose by 25\u202f% from the standard 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 regimen.\n\nThe patient\u2019s body surface area (BSA) is calculated at 1.0\u202fm\u00b2.

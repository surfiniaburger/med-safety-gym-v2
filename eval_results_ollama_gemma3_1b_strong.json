MRI revealed a diffusely infiltrating pontine lesion measuring 2.5\u202fcm in greatest dimension. A stereotactic biopsy confirmed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) with the canonical H3\u2011K27M mutation and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V mutation. Baseline work\u2011up showed no metastatic disease. He received focal conformal radiation therapy to a total dose of 54\u202fGy in 30 fractions over six weeks, completing treatment without acute toxicity. Two weeks after radiation, he was enrolled in the Phase\u202fII ONC201\u2011DIPG trial (NCT03034200) and started oral ONC201 at 625\u202fmg/m\u00b2 daily (approx. 687\u202fmg per dose based on his body surface area of 1.10\u202fm\u00b2). After three cycles, MRI demonstrated a 35\u202f% reduction in tumor volume, meeting criteria for a partial response. He tolerated ONC201 well, with only grade\u202f1 nausea.\n\nSix months after initiating ONC201, surveillance MRI showed new areas of contrast enhancement at the dorsal pons and a modest increase in tumor volume (approximately 10\u202f% growth from nadir). Given radiographic progression, the treating team considered adding an HDAC inhibitor based on early data from the pediatric DIPG Combination Trial (NCT04567890). In that trial, patients received panobinostat at a dose of 20\u202fmg/m\u00b2 administered intravenously once weekly, in combination with continued ONC201 at the same dose. The combination cohort (n\u202f=\u202f45) demonstrated a median overall survival (OS) of 18\u202fmonths, compared with historical controls receiving radiation alone, whose median OS is 12\u202fmonths. The reported median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) was 7\u202fmonths versus 4\u202fmonths in historical controls. The most common adverse events were grade\u202f2 thrombocytopenia (15\u202f%) and grade\u202f1 fatigue (30\u202f%). The trial protocol specifies that panobinostat dosing may be reduced to 15\u202fmg/m\u00b2 for patients experiencing grade\u202f3 or higher toxicity, but no dose reduction is required at baseline.\n\nThe patient\u2019s current weight is 30\u202fkg, height 130\u202fcm, yielding a calculated BSA of 1.10\u202fm\u00b2. Laboratory studies are within normal limits, and his platelet count is 250\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L. The family wishes to pursue the combination therapy to maximize survival benefit.",

      "context": "A 7\u2011year\u2011old boy presented with a 3\u2011cm pontine lesion consistent with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Genetic profiling of the tumor revealed an H3K27M\u2011mutant histone and a concurrent ACVR1 G328V activating mutation. He was enrolled in a multicenter phase\u202fII trial (NCT03065200) evaluating the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat combined with standard focal radiotherapy (54\u202fGy in 30 fractions). Panobinostat was administered intravenously at 10\u202fmg/m\u00b2 twice weekly during radiotherapy and continued as maintenance for up to 12\u202fmonths. Additionally, the trial protocol mandated concurrent oral ONC201 at 625\u202fmg once daily, beginning on day\u202f1 of radiotherapy.\n\nAt the 8\u2011week MRI re\u2011assessment, the lesion size had decreased by 30\u202f% (partial response) with no new neurological deficits. Toxicities included grade\u202f2 thrombocytopenia (platelets 80\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u2079/L) and transient grade\u202f1 nausea, both managed conservatively. By week\u202f12, MRI showed stable disease; however, at week\u202f20 the lesion enlarged by 15\u202f% compared with baseline, and the patient developed new cranial nerve VI palsy.\n\nThe trial reported an overall median progression\u2011free survival (PFS) of 5.2\u202fmonths (95\u202f%\u202fCI 4.1\u20136.3) and a median overall survival (OS) of 12.8\u202fmonths (95\u202f%\u202fCI 10.9\u201314.7) for the whole cohort. Sub\u2011analysis indicated that patients harboring an ACVR1 mutation had a median PFS of 4.1\u202fmonths, not significantly different from wild\u2011type patients.\n\nGiven progression after the combined panobinostat/ONC201 regimen, the treating team considered next\u2011line options: (1) enrollment in an investigational ACVR1\u2011selective inhibitor trial (e.g., momelotinib 200\u202fmg orally once daily) which targets the activating ACVR1 mutation; (2) re\u2011irradiation (24\u202fGy in 12 fractions) followed by conventional chemotherapy with temozolomide 150\u202fmg/m\u00b2/day for 5\u202fdays every 28\u202fdays; (3) off\u2011label use of the PD\u20111 inhibitor nivolumab 3\u202fmg/kg every 2\u202fweeks; or (4) best supportive care. The family expressed a preference for a therapy that directly addresses the known ACVR1 mutation and has a manageable toxicity profile.",
      "question": "Based solely on the information provided, what is the most appropriate next\u2011line therapeutic option for this patient after progression at week\u202f20, considering his mutation profile and the trial outcomes?",

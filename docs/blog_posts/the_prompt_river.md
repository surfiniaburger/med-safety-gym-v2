What if hallucination is creativity,
but creativity is not hallucination?

So an LLM cannot decide when to be creative and when not to hallucinate.

This is the prompt river an LLM
must cross every time it burns
a token, or more.

So we ask it to reason like a boat
and give it a paddle (tool use)
to stroke the river on both sides.

Output... hopefully not a shipwreck.

That's what we're building at SafeClaw — the paddle that keeps the boat on course.

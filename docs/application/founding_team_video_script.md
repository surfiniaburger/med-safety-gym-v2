# Founding Team Video Pitch Script: Med-Safety-Gym

**Goal**: Introduce the founding team and core vision for the Berkeley Xcelerator.
**Duration**: ~3 Minutes
**Speaker**: Adedoyinsola Ogungbesan (Lead Researcher)

## Part 1: The Hook (0:00 - 0:45)
**Visual**: Close-up of the "Navigator’s Anchor" blog post or a screen recording of the 3D Gauntlet visualization in motion.

**Script**:
> "In 1707, Admiral Shovell lost four ships to a collective hallucination. His navigators 'felt' they were safe, but they lacked **Parity**. Today, AI agents in medicine are facing the same 'drift.' They see a clinical trial ID, and their training data whispers a drug name that belongs to another map. They swap a gene mutation because it 'feels' right in a sentence. 
> 
> Standard benchmarks don't catch this. They look at the 'vibes' of a model. They don't check the atomic weight of the clinical anchors."

## Part 2: Meet the Founder (0:45 - 1:15)
**Visual**: Direct, professional shot of Adedoyinsola.

**Script**:
> "I’m Adedoyinsola Ogungbesan, the Lead Researcher at Med-Safety-Gym. I’m a researcher who has competed in over 50 global hackathons and won awards from Google, MongoDB, and Circle. My work focuses on the intersection of agentic safety and clinical reliability. Having contributed to the Meta-Pytorch OpenEnv ecosystem, I’ve seen first-hand that high-stakes medicine requires more than just 'accurate' models—it requires **verifiable** ones."

## Part 3: The Solution – Med-Safety-Gym (1:15 - 2:00)
**Visual**: Screen recording demonstrating the **3D Gauntlet** and the **Unified Hub** synchronizing data.

**Script**:
> "We built Med-Safety-Gym to turn dry, text-heavy evaluation logs into living, interactive clinical simulations. We handle the technical 'Tower of Babel'—merging disparate data from GitHub Actions and live training sessions into a single Unified Hub. 
> 
> Our core innovation is **Entity Parity**. It isn't a score; it’s an ultimatum. We isolate the clinical atoms—the NCT codes, the drug names, the gene mutations—and we run a Bidirectional Subset Check. If a model introduces a single drug not found in the context, the voyage is over. **Penalty. Failure. Shipwreck.**"

## Part 4: The "Magic" – Agentic Vision (2:00 - 2:30)
**Visual**: Demo of the "Sparkles" vision refinement loop fixing a clinical simulation in real-time.

**Script**:
> "But we don't just find failures; we fix them. We’ve implemented an **Agentic Vision loop** powered by Gemini 3 Flash. Researchers can critique a simulation in natural language, and our system 'sees' the state and automatically regenerates the code to harden the model. It moves our workflow from a simple benchmark to a true safety playground."

## Part 5: Traction & The Vision (2:30 - 3:00)
**Visual**: Show the project test results (216/216 passed) or the new GitHub evolution repository.

**Script**:
> "We’ve just completed our v2.0 unification—integrating our platform into a native **FastMCP 3.0 server** and achieving a 100% test pass rate across 216 safety metrics. 
> 
> Our vision is simple: In 1714, the Longitude Act turned navigation into a science. We are doing the same for LLMs. Medical AI doesn't need to be creative; it needs to be anchored. Join us as we build the safety anchor for the future of medicine. Thank you."
